"""
A script to convert quiz questions from JSON format to Brightspace-compatible CSV format.

This script takes a JSON file containing quiz questions and generates a CSV file that can be
imported into Brightspace's quiz system. Each question is formatted according to Brightspace's
specific requirements, including question text, options, correct answers, and metadata.

Classes:
    QuizQuestion: Represents a single multiple choice question with its properties and conversion logic

Functions:
    convert_json_to_brightspace_csv(json_file: str, output_file: str, course_code: str):
        Converts a JSON quiz file to Brightspace CSV format

The JSON file should be structured as a list of question objects. Each question object
should have the following format:

{
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "options": [
        "London",
        "Paris",
        "Berlin",
        "Madrid"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 1  # Index of correct option (0-based)
}

The script generates a CSV file with the following Brightspace-specific columns:
- NewQuestion: Indicates the start of a new question
- ID: Unique identifier for the question
- Title: Question title
- QuestionText: The actual question text
- Points: Question point value
- Difficulty: Question difficulty level
- Image: Reference to associated image
- Option: Answer choices with points and feedback
