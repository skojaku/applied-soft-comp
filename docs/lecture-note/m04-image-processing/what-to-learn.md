# Module 3: Image Processing

## What to learn in this module

In this module, we will learn how to use neural networks to learn representations of images. We will learn:
- Fourier transform on images
- Image processing using Fourier transform
- Convolutional neural networks
- LeNet
- AlexNet
- VGG
- Inception
- ResNet
- VisTransformer (if time permits)
