title: "Sprint Project: The Tidy Data Escape Room"
---

::: {.callout-note title="Your mission"}
You have 60 minutes to clean a catastrophic CSV into tidy format while maintaining granular Git history. Then present your approach and results to the class.
:::

## The Challenge

You receive a dataset riddled with merged cells, color-coded metadata, and every tidy data violation imaginable. Transform it into pristine tidy format where each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type forms a table. The twist: every meaningful edit requires its own commit with a descriptive message.

## The Rules

**Time:** 60 minutes of work, followed by presentations.

**Version Control:** Every change must be committed and pushed. No batch commits. Your commit messages must explain why you made each change.

**Requirements:** Final dataset must be truly tidy. No metadata in data cells, no implicit missing values, no ambiguous column names.

## Evaluation

Judges evaluate three dimensions:

**Data Quality (40%):** Is the dataset immediately usable for analysis? Are types correct and missing values explicit?

**Git History (40%):** Do commits tell a story? Are they atomic and well-described?

**Presentation (20%):** Can you clearly explain your cleaning strategy and key decisions?

## Deliverables

Your submission should include:

1. **Cleaned Dataset:** The final tidy CSV file
2. **Git History:** Granular commits with descriptive messages explaining each cleaning step
3. **Report:** A brief markdown document explaining:
   - What problems you found in the original dataset
   - Your cleaning strategy and key decisions
   - Challenges encountered and how you solved them
