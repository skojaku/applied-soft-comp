::: {.callout-note title="What you'll learn in this module"}
This module introduces the tools and principles of reproducible data science.

You'll learn:

- How **version control with Git and GitHub** tracks changes and enables effective collaboration.
- What **data provenance** is and why knowing your data's history builds trust and enables reproducibility.
- How **tidy data principles** structure datasets to make analysis faster, clearer, and less error-prone.
- How to build **reproducible environments** so others can replicate your work exactly, regardless of platform or time.

## The Journey

Let's talk about where this module takes you. We begin with the reproducibility crisis and build up to a complete toolkit for trustworthy data science. Each part solves a specific problem that haunts researchers and practitioners.

**[Version Control with Git & GitHub](git-github.qmd)**

Have you ever lost days of work to an accidental overwrite? Version control transforms chaos into clarity. You'll learn how Git tracks every change, enables collaboration without conflicts, and lets you recover from mistakes instantly.

**[Data Provenance](data-provenance.qmd)**

Shift your attention from tools to the data itself. Where did your data come from? How was it collected? What transformations were applied? Knowing your data's complete history is the backbone of good science.

**[Tidy Data](tidy-data.qmd)**

Structure matters. When you organize data tidily, analysis becomes straightforward. When data is messy, simple tasks become painful. You'll learn the principles that distinguish clean datasets from nightmares.

**[Reproducible Environments & Projects](reproduceability.qmd)**

Your code works perfectly on your machine today. But will it run on your colleague's machine tomorrow? Will it work six months from now after library updates? Reproducible environments ensure your work replicates exactly, no matter where or when it runs.

## Why This Matters

Here's something remarkable. The reproducibility crisis isn't about fraud. It's about losing track of details. A colleague asks for your code from last year. You search frantically. Which files? Which version? Which environment produced that final figure?

These stories are all too common. What ties them together? The need for provenance, a complete lineage of data and code from origin to final form. Provenance lets others verify your findings and build upon your work.

A little organization upfront saves hours of pain later. These practices make you a more effective and trustworthy collaborator. They transform scattered files into coherent projects. They turn "it works on my machine" into "it works everywhere."

## Prerequisites

You should be comfortable with basic Python programming. Familiarity with the command line helps but isn't required. We'll teach you the essential terminal operations you need.

No prior experience with Git, data management, or environment tools is necessary. This module assumes you're starting from scratch. By the end, you'll have solid foundations in reproducible practices.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this module, you'll track changes with Git and collaborate through GitHub. You'll structure data clearly using tidy principles. You'll build replicable environments using conda or virtual environments.

You'll gain practical skills: creating repositories, writing clear commit messages, managing branches, documenting data sources, and configuring project dependencies. Most importantly, you'll develop habits that make reproducibility automatic rather than an afterthought.

Let's begin by tackling the reproducibility crisis head-on.
