::: {.callout-note title="What you'll learn in this module"}
This module introduces the tools and principles of reproducible data science. We will explore version control with Git and GitHub to track changes and collaborate effectively. We will examine data provenance and tidy data principles to ensure your data history is clear and your structure is sound. Finally, we will learn how to build reproducible environments so others can replicate your work exactly.

## The Reproducibility Crisis

Have you ever spent months on a groundbreaking data analysis, only to discover you can't reproduce your own results? It happens more often than you think. A colleague asks for your code from last year. You search frantically. Which files? Which version? Which environment produced that final figure?

These stories are all too common. What ties them together? The need for **provenance**, a complete lineage of data and code from origin to final form. Provenance is the backbone of good science. It lets others verify your findings and build upon your work.

A little organization upfront saves hours of pain later. This module teaches you the tools and principles that make reproducible data science pipelines possible.

## Version Control

Let's start with version control. Without proper tracking, accidents happen. You lose days of work to an accidental overwrite. A security breach occurs because no one knows which version is running. Version control transforms this chaos into clarity.

Git and GitHub let you track every change. You can collaborate without stepping on each other's toes. You can recover from mistakes instantly. Ready to dive deeper? Learn more about [Version Control with Git & GitHub](git-github.qmd).

## Data Provenance and Tidy Data

Shift your attention from tools to the data itself. You need two things. First, know the history of your data. This is called **data provenance**. Second, structure it to make analysis straightforward. This is called **tidy data**.

Why does data history matter? Knowing where your data came from, how it was collected, and what transformations were applied builds trust. Reproducibility depends on this knowledge. When you structure data tidily, analysis becomes faster, clearer, and less error-prone. Ready to explore? Check out [Data Provenance](data-provenance.qmd) and [Tidy Data](tidy-data.qmd).

## Reproducible Environments

Think about the environment where your code runs. Your code works perfectly on your machine today. But will it run on your colleague's machine tomorrow? Will it work on your machine six months from now after library updates?

These questions matter. Reproducible environments ensure your work replicates exactly, no matter where or when it runs. This is the final piece of the reproducibility puzzle. Ready to complete the picture? Discover [Reproducible Environments & Projects](reproduceability.qmd).

## What You'll Gain

By the end of this module, you'll have a solid foundation in reproducible data science. You'll track changes with version control, structure data clearly, and build replicable environments. These practices make you a more effective and trustworthy collaborator.
