### The Day the Code Disappeared

Picture this: you're working late on a project, you've finally fixed a major bug, and you're about to go home. You close your laptop, and the next morning, you open it up to find that all your changes from the previous day are gone. Your heart sinks. You have no idea what you did to fix the bug, and you have to start all over again.

Even the pros can make mistakes. In 2017, GitLab, a major code hosting platform, suffered a catastrophic outage. A system administrator accidentally deleted a massive amount of production data, and the backups... well, they didn't work as expected. The company lost six hours of customer data, a lifetime in the fast-paced world of software development.

### Version Control

Version control is a very important part of any data-related work.
A version control system (VCS) saves "snapshots" of your files. The most popular system today is **Git**, and when you put Git in the cloud (like on **GitHub**), you can access your work from anywhere, share it, and even show it off.

The following blog is a good minimal documentation about `git` and `github`.

- [A layman’s introduction to Git](https://webtuu.com/blog/04/a-laymans-introduction-to-git)

You can also test your understanding of Git and GitHub with the following interactive tutorial:

- [Interactive Git Tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - Visual, hands-on learning

For more comprehensive documentation, you can refer to the following resources:

- [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)
- [Atlassian Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) - Detailed tutorials with examples

And I recommend the beginners to start with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), instead of command line, to manage your Git repositories.
