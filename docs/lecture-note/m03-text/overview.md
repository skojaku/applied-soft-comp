In this module, we will learn about the modern natural language processing, especially the large language models. We start from applications and then down to the theory. Starting from what the large language model is. And then we will learn about the prompt engineering. Then we will unbox the large language models, understanding the core technology called the transformer modules, and the retention mechanisms. And then we will learn about the embedding, which represents the internal data representations of large language models. And how we can use embedding to prove natural language. Undergraded orادm12b, is the original natural language model of a script painting? Now, the novel is about three different ways of entering into the mix,
