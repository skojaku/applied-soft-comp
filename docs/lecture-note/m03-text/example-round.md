Round 4: Double Story Track
Learning Objective: Understanding parallel memory streams

Memory Paper:
Story A: [ Box 1A ][ Box 2A ][ Box 3A ]
Story B: [ Box 1B ][ Box 2B ][ Box 3B ]

Student Private Info:
1. [🏃‍♂️][🌧️] "John running in rain" | "Mary reading book"
2. [🚌][📚] "Bus is late" | "Library closing soon"
3. [💼][🏃‍♀️] "Important meeting" | "Mary running to library"
4. [😰][❌] "John worried" | "Library closed"
5. [📱][😢] "Meeting cancelled" | "Mary disappointed"

Final Question: "Who had a worse day and why?"

Mechanics:
- Must update both story tracks
- Limited to 3 marker uses total (forces choices)
- Can transfer info between tracks

Round 5: Time-Sensitive Memory
Learning Objective: Learning importance weighting

Memory Paper: [ Box 1 ][ Box 2 ][ Box 3 ]
Importance Scale: (1-5) next to each box

Student Private Info:
1. [🕐] "Train leaves at 3PM" (importance: 5)
2. [🎫] "Ticket in blue wallet" (importance: 4)
3. [👕] "Packed red shirt" (importance: 1)
4. [🌧️] "Heavy rain forecast" (importance: 3)
5. [🚕] "Taxi strike today" (importance: 5)

Final Question: "Will they catch the train? What's the critical info?"

Mechanics:
- Can only erase lower importance info
- Must maintain at least one high-importance (4-5) item
- New info must be rated for importance

Round 6: Context-Dependent Memory
Learning Objective: Understanding conditional information processing

Memory Paper: [ Context ][ Box 1 ][ Box 2 ][ Box 3 ]
Context Options: HOME, WORK, TRAVEL

Student Private Info:
1. [🏠] "Dog needs walk" | "Meeting at 2" | "Pack umbrella"
2. [📞] "Mom calling" | "Client email" | "Flight delayed"
3. [🍽️] "Empty fridge" | "Deadline today" | "Hotel booked"
4. [💡] "Power out" | "Presentation ready" | "Passport check"
5. [🔑] "Door locked" | "Office closed" | "Taxi arriving"

Final Question: "What actions are needed?" (Asked with specific context)

Mechanics:
- Context box must be updated first
- Information relevance depends on current context
- Some info may be relevant across multiple contexts

🎯 Learning Connections to LSTM:
- Round 4: Multiple memory cells
- Round 5: Input gate mechanics (importance weighting)
- Round 6: Context-dependent forget gate

📝 Assessment Ideas:
- Track which information survives multiple passes
- Analyze decision patterns for memory updates
- Compare strategies across different groups
