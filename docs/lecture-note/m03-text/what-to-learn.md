# Module 2: Language Models

## What to learn in this module

In this module, we will learn about recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that can process sequential text data. We will learn:
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for processing sequential text data
- Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing long-range dependencies
- Sequence-to-sequence models for machine translation
- The Attention mechanism for focusing on relevant parts of text
