::: {.callout-note title="What you'll learn in this module"}
This module extends deep learning from regular grids to irregular structures. We explore how convolution generalizes to graphs, building on your knowledge of CNNs to tackle networks with varying connectivity patterns. You will understand both spectral and spatial perspectives on graph neural networks, and learn how to embed networks into continuous vector spaces.

## From Pixels to Nodes

You have learned how convolutional neural networks process images. A kernel slides across a regular grid, extracting features through local operations. The grid structure makes this straightforward: every pixel (except boundaries) has the same number of neighbors, and the same kernel applies everywhere.

Networks shatter this regularity. Consider a social network where some people have 5 friends and others have 500. Or a molecule where atoms have varying numbers of bonds. How do we define convolution when neighborhoods have wildly different sizes? How do we share parameters across nodes with different connectivity patterns?

This module answers these questions. We extend the principles that make CNNs powerful (locality, parameter sharing, hierarchical features) to irregular graph structures. The journey reveals that convolution is not about grids. It is about relationships, and relationships exist everywhere.

## The Module Roadmap

We approach graph neural networks through a carefully constructed narrative that builds on what you already know.

**Part 1: From Images to Graphs** introduces the pixel-node analogy and explains why irregular structure poses challenges. We preview two complementary perspectives: spectral methods that define convolution in frequency domains, and spatial methods that aggregate information from local neighborhoods.

**Part 2: The Spectral Perspective** explores how graphs have their own notion of frequency. The graph Laplacian's eigenvectors serve as basis functions, and eigenvalues indicate how rapidly node features vary across edges. We design spectral filters that control which frequencies pass through, and build learnable spectral graph convolutional networks. We also examine why computational cost and lack of spatial locality motivate spatial approaches.

**Part 3: Spatial Graph Networks** defines convolution as neighborhood aggregation. We see how ChebNet bridges spectral and spatial domains, how GCN achieves radical simplification, and how modern architectures like GraphSAGE, GAT, and GIN push boundaries. GraphSAGE samples neighborhoods for scalability. Graph Attention Networks learn which neighbors matter most. Graph Isomorphism Networks maximize discriminative power through careful aggregation design.

**Part 4: Graph Embeddings** shifts from supervised learning to representation learning. We explore both spectral embeddings rooted in eigendecomposition and neural embeddings inspired by word2vec. Random walks transform graphs into sequences, enabling us to treat nodes as words and apply language modeling techniques. These embeddings enable clustering, visualization, and transfer learning across tasks.

## Why This Matters

Graph-structured data appears everywhere. Social networks capture friendships and influence. Knowledge graphs encode facts and relationships. Molecules represent atoms and bonds. Citation networks link papers and ideas. Protein interaction networks reveal biological pathways.

Traditional machine learning struggles with graphs. Most algorithms assume feature vectors in Euclidean space, but graphs are discrete, irregular, and high-dimensional. Graph neural networks solve this by learning representations that preserve structure while enabling standard machine learning techniques.

The applications are transformative. Drug discovery benefits from predicting molecular properties. Recommendation systems leverage social network structure. Fraud detection identifies suspicious patterns in transaction graphs. Scientific discovery accelerates by mining knowledge graphs for hidden connections.

## What to Expect

This module assumes you understand basic linear algebra (matrices, eigenvalues, eigenvectors) and neural networks (layers, activations, backpropagation). We build heavily on your knowledge of CNNs from Module 5, drawing parallels between image convolution and graph convolution.

The mathematics is more involved than previous modules. Spectral graph theory connects linear algebra to networks. Understanding eigendecompositions and Laplacian matrices requires careful attention. But the payoff is worth it. These concepts reveal deep connections between seemingly disparate ideas: Fourier analysis, random walks, and neural networks.

The coding examples use real networks like the Karate Club. You will implement spectral embeddings, train DeepWalk models, and visualize learned representations. These hands-on experiences cement abstract concepts and show how theory translates to practice.

## The Bigger Picture

This module represents a frontier in deep learning. CNNs revolutionized computer vision by exploiting grid structure. Transformers revolutionized NLP by modeling token sequences. Graph neural networks extend these successes to irregular structures, unlocking applications where relationships matter as much as features.

The principles transcend specific architectures. Locality enables learning from neighbors without considering the entire graph. Parameter sharing allows models trained on small networks to generalize to large ones. Hierarchical features extract increasingly abstract patterns through stacked layers.

These ideas connect to broader themes in machine learning. Inductive biases (built-in assumptions about structure) determine what models can learn efficiently. The right representation (embeddings that preserve relevant properties) enables simple algorithms to solve complex tasks. Domain knowledge (understanding graph structure) guides architecture design.

## Getting Started

Begin with [Part 1: From Images to Graphs](01-from-images-to-graphs.qmd) to understand the core challenge and preview the solution strategies. The narrative builds systematically, so follow the parts in order for maximum clarity.

Each part includes visualizations, examples, and derivations. Take time to understand the intuitions before diving into mathematical details. The equations formalize ideas that make sense geometrically: smoothness, frequency, aggregation, attention.

By the end of this module, you will understand how to extend deep learning beyond regular structures. You will see connections between spectral graph theory, signal processing, and neural networks. You will appreciate why graph neural networks have become indispensable tools for modern machine learning.

The journey from pixels to nodes reveals a profound truth: the core principles of deep learning transcend any particular data structure. Wherever relationships exist, we can learn.
