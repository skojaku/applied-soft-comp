::: {.callout-note title="Your mission"}
You have 60 minutes to identify critical edges whose removal will maximally degrade network efficiency. Predict vulnerable edges *before* computing centrality. Then present your attack strategy and results to the class.
:::

## The Challenge

You receive a network graph (social, transportation, etc.). Remove the minimum number of edges (typically 3-5) to either fragment the network or double average shortest path length. The challenge: predict critical edges using only visual inspection before calculating any centrality metrics. Then test if your intuition beats algorithmic approaches.

## Kickstarter Code

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the network
G = nx.read_edgelist('data/network.txt')

# Visualize the network
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue',
        node_size=500, font_size=10)
plt.show()

# Baseline metrics
print(f"Number of components: {nx.number_connected_components(G)}")
print(f"Average shortest path: {nx.average_shortest_path_length(G):.3f}")

# PREDICTION PHASE - Write down your edge predictions first!
predicted_edges = [
    # (node1, node2),  # Reason: ...
    # (node3, node4),  # Reason: ...
]

# Test your predictions
G_attacked = G.copy()
G_attacked.remove_edges_from(predicted_edges)

# Measure impact
print(f"\nAfter attack:")
print(f"Number of components: {nx.number_connected_components(G_attacked)}")
if nx.is_connected(G_attacked):
    print(f"Average shortest path: {nx.average_shortest_path_length(G_attacked):.3f}")

# Compare with betweenness centrality
edge_betweenness = nx.edge_betweenness_centrality(G)
top_edges = sorted(edge_betweenness.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:5]
print("\nTop edges by betweenness:")
for edge, score in top_edges:
    print(f"{edge}: {score:.3f}")
```

## The Rules

**Time:** 60 minutes of work, followed by presentations.

**Prediction Phase:** Write down edge predictions and reasoning *before* computing any metrics.

**Removal Strategy:** Remove up to N edges (specified per network). Document your reasoning.

**Impact Measurement:** Compute number of components, average shortest path length, and largest component size.

**Baseline Comparison:** Compare against removing edges by betweenness centrality.

## Evaluation

Judges compare damage inflicted:

**Fragmentation (30%):** How many components created?

**Path Length Increase (30%):** Percentage increase in average shortest path?

**Intuition vs. Algorithm (40%):** Did your intuitive picks beat betweenness centrality baseline?

## Deliverables

Your submission should include:

1. **Predictions:** Written edge predictions with reasoning (before computing metrics)
2. **Analysis Code:** Script or notebook computing impact metrics
3. **Visualizations:** Before and after network visualizations
4. **Report:** A brief markdown document explaining:
   - Your intuitive reasoning for edge selection
   - Impact metrics (fragmentation, path length increase)
   - Comparison with betweenness centrality baseline
