::: {.callout-note title="Your mission"}
You have 60 minutes to identify critical edges whose removal will maximally degrade network efficiency. Predict vulnerable edges *before* computing centrality. Then present your attack strategy and results to the class.
:::

## The Challenge

You receive a network graph (social, transportation, etc.). Remove the minimum number of edges (typically 3-5) to either fragment the network or double average shortest path length. The challenge: predict critical edges using only visual inspection before calculating any centrality metrics. Then test if your intuition beats algorithmic approaches.

## The Rules

**Time:** 60 minutes of work, followed by presentations.

**Prediction Phase:** Write down edge predictions and reasoning *before* computing any metrics.

**Removal Strategy:** Remove up to N edges (specified per network). Document your reasoning.

**Impact Measurement:** Compute number of components, average shortest path length, and largest component size.

**Baseline Comparison:** Compare against removing edges by betweenness centrality.

## Evaluation

Judges compare damage inflicted:

**Fragmentation (30%):** How many components created?

**Path Length Increase (30%):** Percentage increase in average shortest path?

**Intuition vs. Algorithm (40%):** Did your intuitive picks beat betweenness centrality baseline?
