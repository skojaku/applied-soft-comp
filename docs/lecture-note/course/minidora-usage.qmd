## Getting Started with Minidora

Minidora is your personal AI tutor available 24/7 through Discord to help you master deep learning and complex systems concepts. She's designed to provide personalized learning support, answer questions about course materials, and guide you through challenging topics with patience and clarity. To interact with Minidora, simply use Discord slash commands or mention her directly in any channel or thread where she's present.

Check out the instruction here on how to use Minidora: [Minidora Usage](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fIKkEjUlGBIXvnXQiIKMQBuRtLUMZW3p0dW7F8m9Emg/edit?usp=sharing). Minidora is available on Discord, and you can find the invitation link on the email sent in the first week of the semester. Or you can find the invitation link on the Brightspace.

::: {.callout-note}
Some students could not find Minidora on Discord. The easiest way to get around this is:

1. Go to the course discord server
2. Open the "applied-soft-computing" channel.
3. Click the Minidora icon and send a direct message
4. Type "/" and see if the available commands are shown.

## Asking Questions

The most straightforward way to get help is using the `/ask` command followed by your question. For example, suppose that you want to ask about a subject (Word embeddings) in module 3.

1. Type `/ask` then type space.
2. Type your question (e.g., `What are word embeddings and how does Word2Vec work?`)
3. Type space
4. You will be prompted to specify the module id. The id consists of "m<module number in two digits>". For example, if it is module 3, you should type `m03`. Type the module id.
5. Then type enter.

Minidora will then read the lecture content and provide an explanation.

## Natural Conversations and Interactive Learning

For a more conversational experience, use the `/chat` command which allows you to interact with Minidora in a natural, free-flowing manner. You can say things like `/chat I'm confused about transformers, can you explain the attention mechanism step by step?` or `/chat Can you help me debug this Python code for training a CNN?` Minidora will engage in back-and-forth dialogue, ask clarifying questions, and adapt her explanations based on your responses.

Note that `/chat` does not contextualize the Minidora to the course materials. That means that it does not read the lecture content and interact with the students with its built-in knowledge.

## Quizzes and Assessment

To test your understanding and reinforce learning, Minidora offers intelligent quiz features through the `/quiz` command. She can generate concept-based questions using `/concept-quiz m03 multiple-choice` for theoretical understanding, or coding challenges with `/code-quiz m03` to practice implementation skills. Minidora tracks your progress and adapts quiz difficulty based on your performance, focusing on areas where you need more practice. You can also request quizzes on specific topics by adding subject keywords, such as `/quiz m04 convolutional neural networks`.

## Tracking Your Progress

Use the `/status` command to monitor your learning journey and see detailed insights about your progress. Minidora provides different status views: `/status summary` gives you a quick overview of questions asked and concepts mastered, while `/status concepts` shows which topics you've learned and what to study next. The `/status profile` command reveals your personalized learning profile, including your preferred difficulty level, learning style, and areas where you excel or need additional support. This helps Minidora provide increasingly personalized assistance as you continue learning.
