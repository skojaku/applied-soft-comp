Complex systems are everywhere—from social networks shaping our daily interactions to neural networks powering AI systems. This course explores computational intelligence from the ground up, combining hands-on deep learning with complexity science to unlock the secrets of emergent behaviors in large-scale systems.

## About Us


### Instructor

Welcome! My name is [Sadamori Kojaku](https://skojaku.github.io/), and I am the instructor of this course.
The field of applied soft computing, which in part intersects with deep learning, is a very fast-paced area.
The field is so fast-paced that I always feel like I'm not "teaching" students. Instead, I'm more like a student myself walking through the same journey with you.

This is my third offering of this course, and everytime I have to look through the latest research and update the lecture notes to an extent beyond a simple minor text update.
This time, I have included two new modules, i.e., *agentic coding* and *representation learning*, with former module designed to help students make use of advanced AI tools for research and for personal projects, and the later for philosophical and theoretical discussions on what ML/AI actually learn from data.
All other modules are substantially restructured to align with the key theme: *how can we make use of advanced AI tools for my research?*, with a target audience being Systems Science students and Engineering students interested in applied computing.

I have implemented several tricks to make the course fun and engaging, like Discord chatbot "Chibi", mini projects, and pen and paper exercises. I hope you will enjoy and find the course useful in your future endeavors.

With Chibi, you can:


- **Query Course Content**: Ask questions about specific lectures or concepts directly on Discord.
- **Test Your Knowledge**: Generate personalized quizzes for any module using the `/quiz` command.
- **Challenge the AI**: Engage in "LLM-Quizzes" where you attempt to create questions that the AI cannot answer correctly.
- **Monitor Mastery**: Track your learning progress and identify areas for improvement with the `/status` command.
