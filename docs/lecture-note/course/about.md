Complex systems are everywhereâ€”from social networks shaping our daily interactions to neural networks powering AI systems. This course explores computational intelligence from the ground up, combining hands-on deep learning with complexity science to unlock the secrets of emergent behaviors in large-scale systems.

## About Us


### Instructor

::: {#first-column}
Welcome! My name is Sadamori Kojaku, the instructor of this course.
I started my career as a computer scientist but couldn't resist falling in love with Complex Systems and Network Science right after I got my Ph.D.
Complex systems appear in many different forms in our daily livesâ€”social networks, biological systems, the internet, power grids, and you name it.
But when we represent them using modern deep learning techniques, we can understand them in unified ways.
We can study them using the same toolkit no matter what the domain is, and can find universal patterns and principles that govern seemingly different systems.
Even more fascinating, large-scale deep learning models themselves exhibit emergent behaviors as complex systems!
Sounds fun, right ðŸ˜‰?

This course will guide you through the fascinating intersection of deep learning and complex systems, from foundational theory to hands-on coding and real-world applications.
I hope you will enjoy and find the course useful in your future endeavors.

**Minidora** is an AI tutor robot conceived in the 22nd century and deployed in the present era to support students. (The original character is designed by [Fujiko Fujio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujiko_Fujio) for a famous Japanese manga called [Doraemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon)). Minidora supports students in this course by providing dialogic explanations, quiz questions, and coding guidance on the course Discord.
