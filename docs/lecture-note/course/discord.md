We use a dedicated **Discord server** for this course to facilitate communication, Q&A, and collaboration outside of class. The Discord server is a space where you can:

- Ask questions about lectures, assignments, and projects
- Discuss concepts and share resources with your peers
- Get support from the instructor, TA, and Minidora (the AI tutor)
- Join study groups and participate in informal discussions

**Invitation links to the Discord server will be distributed via Brightspace.**
Please check the Brightspace announcements or course materials for the latest invite link.

Once you join, you'll find channels for different topics (e.g., #random, #questions, #study-groups) and can interact with both classmates, AI tutor, and course staff. If you're new to Discord, it's a free platform available on web, desktop, and mobile.
