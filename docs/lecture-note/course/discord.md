We use a dedicated **Discord server** for this course to facilitate communication, Q&A, and collaboration outside of class. The Discord server is a space where you can:

- Ask questions about lectures, assignments, and projects
- Discuss concepts and share resources with your peers
- Get support from the instructor, TA, and **Chibi** (the AI tutor)
- **Record your class attendance**
- **Complete mandatory module quizzes** with the AI Tutor
- Join study groups and participate in informal discussions

**Invitation links to the Discord server will be distributed via Brightspace.**
Please check the Brightspace announcements or course materials for the latest invite link.

Once you join, you'll find channels for different topics (e.g., #random, #questions, #study-groups) and can interact with both classmates, AI tutor, and course staff. If you're new to Discord, it's a free platform available on web, desktop, and mobile.

### AI Tutor & Assignments

This course heavily utilizes the AI Tutor (**Chibi**) for:

1.  **Attendance Tracking**: You must use the `/here` command during class.
2.  **Assignments**: Every module requires completing quizzes with the bot.

For detailed instructions, please read the **[Discord Bot Usage](discord-bot-usage.qmd)** guide.
