# Welcome to Applied Soft Computing: Modeling Complex Systems with Deep Learning!

Welcome to the course! In this class, we will explore how **deep learning serves as a powerful tool to operationalize high-dimensional data from social and physical systems**. You'll learn to model complex system dynamics using modern computational intelligence, and in turn, use perspectives from complexity science to **understand the emergent behaviors of large-scale models**.

This course is designed to provide you with both a **theoretical foundation** and **hands-on experience** in applied soft computing. You will learn how to apply representation learning, sequence modeling, and graph analytics to model real-world complex systems using Python and modern deep learning frameworks.

## What to Expect

- **Engaging Lectures:** Each week, we'll dive into key concepts in deep learning and complex systems, supported by interactive discussions and in-class activities.
- **Hands-on Coding:** You'll work with real data from text, images, and networks using Python and modern deep learning tools.
- **Collaborative Learning:** Participate in group activities, discussions, and our dedicated [Discord server](discord.md) for Q&A and support.
- **Projects and Assignments:** Apply your knowledge through coding assignments, quizzes, and a final project.
- **Support:** Get help from the instructor, TA, and our AI tutor, Minidora.

## How to Get Started

1. **Read the [About Us](about.md) page** to meet your instructor, TA, and Minidora.
2. **Join the [Discord server](discord.md)** for announcements, help, and community.
3. **Set up your Python environment** by following the [Setup Guide](setup.qmd).
4. **Learn how to [submit assignments](how-to-submit-assignment.md)** using GitHub Classroom.
