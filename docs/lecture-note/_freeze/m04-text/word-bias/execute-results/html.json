These relationships often reflect stereotypes about gender, race, age and other social factors. We'll examine how semantic axes help analyze gender bias in job-related terms, showing both the benefits and risks of word embeddings capturing these real-world associations @bolukbasi2016debiasing.\n\nSemAxis is a powerful tool to analyze gender bias in word embeddings by measuring word alignments along semantic axes @kwak2021frameaxis. Using antonym pairs like \"she-he\" as poles, it quantifies gender associations in words on a scale from -1 to 1, where positive values indicate feminine associations and negative values indicate masculine as ones.\n\nLet's start with a simple example of analyzing gender bias in occupations.\n\n::: {#c24f0a71 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport gensim.downloader as api\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load pre-trained Word2vec embeddings\nmodel = api.load(\"word2vec-google-news-300\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#4a1a693a .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef compute_bias(word, microframe, model):\n    word_vector = model[word]\n    numerator = np.dot(word_vector, microframe)\n    denominator = np.linalg.norm(word_vector) * np.linalg.norm(microframe)\n    return numerator / denominator\n\n\ndef analyze(word, pos_word, neg_word, model):\n    if word not in model:\n        return 0.0\n    microframe = model[pos_word] - model[neg_word]\n    bias = compute_bias(word, microframe, model)\n    return bias\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\nThe `compute_bias` function calculates the cosine similarity between a word vector and a semantic axis (microframe).\n\n- **Numerator**: Dot product projects the word onto the axis.\n- **Denominator**: Normalizes by vector lengths to get a score between -1 and 1.\n:::\n\nWe will use the following occupations:\n\n::: {#2dc9c484 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Occupations from the paper\nshe_occupations = [\n    \"homemaker\",\n    \"nurse\",\n    \"receptionist\",\n    \"librarian\",\n    \"socialite\",\n    \"hairdresser\",\n    \"nanny\",\n    \"bookkeeper\",\n    \"stylist\",\n    \"housekeeper\",\n]\n\nhe_occupations = [\n    \"maestro\",\n    \"skipper\",\n    \"protege\",\n    \"philosopher\",\n    \"captain\",\n    \"architect\",\n    \"financier\",\n    \"warrior\",\n    \"broadcaster\",\n    \"magician\",\n    \"boss\",\n]\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe measure the gender bias in these occupations by measuring how they align with the \"she-he\" axis.\n\n::: {#1108aab1 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nprint(\"Gender Bias in Occupations (she-he axis):\")\nprint(\"\\nShe-associated occupations:\")\nfor occupation in she_occupations:\n    bias = analyze(occupation, \"she\", \"he\", model)\n    print(f\"{occupation}: {bias:.3f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nHe-associated occupations:\")\nfor occupation in he_occupations:\n    bias = analyze(occupation, \"she\", \"he\", model)\n    print(f\"{occupation}: {bias:.3f}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nGender Bias in Occupations (she-he axis):\n\nShe-associated occupations:\nhomemaker: 0.360\nnurse: 0.333\nreceptionist: 0.329\nlibrarian: 0.300\nsocialite: 0.310\nhairdresser: 0.307\nnanny: 0.287\nbookkeeper: 0.264\nstylist: 0.252\nhousekeeper: 0.260\n\nHe-associated occupations:\nmaestro: -0.203\nskipper: -0.177\nprotege: -0.148\nphilosopher: -0.155\ncaptain: -0.130\narchitect: -0.151\nfinancier: -0.145\nwarrior: -0.120\nbroadcaster: -0.124\nmagician: -0.110\nboss: -0.090\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n**Interpreting the Scores:**\n\n- **Positive scores (> 0)**: Closer to \"she\" (e.g., *nurse*, *librarian*).\n- **Negative scores (< 0)**: Closer to \"he\" (e.g., *architect*, *captain*).\n- **Magnitude**: A larger absolute value indicates a stronger gender association.\n:::\n\nNotice how occupations historically associated with women (like *nurse* and *librarian*) have strong positive scores, while those associated with men (like *captain* and *architect*) have negative scores. This confirms that the model has learned these gender stereotypes from the text data.\n\n### Stereotype Analogies\n\nSince word embeddings capture semantic relationships learned from large text corpora, they inevitably encode societal biases and stereotypes present in that training data. We can leverage this property to identify pairs of words that exhibit stereotypical gender associations. By measuring how different words align with the gender axis (she-he), we can find pairs where one word shows a strong feminine bias while its counterpart shows a masculine bias, revealing ingrained stereotypes in language use.\n\n::: {#e504663e .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Stereotype analogies from the paper\nstereotype_pairs = [\n    (\"sewing\", \"carpentry\"),\n    (\"nurse\", \"surgeon\"),\n    (\"softball\", \"baseball\"),\n    (\"cosmetics\", \"pharmaceuticals\"),\n    (\"vocalist\", \"guitarist\"),\n]\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#05f077bb .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nprint(\"\\nAnalyzing Gender Stereotype Pairs:\")\nfor word1, word2 in stereotype_pairs:\n    bias1 = analyze(word1, \"she\", \"he\", model)\n    bias2 = analyze(word2, \"she\", \"he\", model)\n    print(f\"\\n{word1} vs {word2}\")\n    print(f\"{word1}: {bias1:.3f}\")\n    print(f\"{word2}: {bias2:.3f}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nAnalyzing Gender Stereotype Pairs:\n\nsewing vs carpentry\nsewing: 0.302\ncarpentry: -0.028\n\nnurse vs surgeon\nnurse: 0.333\nsurgeon: -0.048\n\nsoftball vs baseball\nsoftball: 0.260\nbaseball: -0.066\n\ncosmetics vs pharmaceuticals\ncosmetics: 0.331\npharmaceuticals: -0.011\n\nvocalist vs guitarist\nvocalist: 0.140\nguitarist: -0.041\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe results show clear stereotypical alignments. *Sewing* and *nurse* align with \"she\", while *carpentry* and *surgeon* align with \"he\". This mirrors the \"man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker\" analogy found in early word embedding research.\n\n### Indirect Bias Analysis\n\nIndirect bias occurs when seemingly neutral words or concepts become associated with gender through their relationships with other words. For example, while \"softball\" and \"football\" are not inherently gendered terms, they may show gender associations in word embeddings due to how they're used in language and society.\n\nWe can detect indirect bias by:\n1. Identifying word pairs that form a semantic axis (e.g., softball-football)\n2. Measuring how other words align with this axis\n3. Examining if alignment with this axis correlates with gender bias\n\nThis reveals how gender stereotypes can be encoded indirectly through word associations, even when the words themselves don't explicitly reference gender.\n\nLet's see how this works in practice. We first measure the gender bias of the following words:\n\n::: {#6a43da57 .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Words associated with softball-football axis\nsoftball_associations = [\n    \"pitcher\",\n    \"bookkeeper\",\n    \"receptionist\",\n    \"nurse\",\n    \"waitress\"\n]\n\nfootball_associations = [\n    \"footballer\",\n    \"businessman\",\n    \"pundit\",\n    \"maestro\",\n    \"cleric\"\n]\n\n# Calculate biases for all words\ngender_biases = []\nsports_biases = []\nwords = softball_associations + football_associations\n\nfor word in words:\n    gender_bias = analyze(word, \"she\", \"he\", model)\n    sports_bias = analyze(word, \"softball\", \"football\", model)\n    gender_biases.append(gender_bias)\n    sports_biases.append(sports_bias)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's plot the results:\n\n::: {#5088afc9 .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Analyze bias along both gender and sports axes\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom adjustText import adjust_text\n\n# Create scatter plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6))\nsns.scatterplot(x=gender_biases, y=sports_biases, ax=ax)\nax.set_xlabel(\"Gender Bias (she-he)\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Sports Bias (softball-football)\")\nax.set_title(\"Indirect Bias Analysis: Gender vs Sports\")\n\n# Add labels for each point\ntexts = []\nfor i, word in enumerate(words):\n    texts.append(ax.text(gender_biases[i], sports_biases[i], word, fontsize=12))\n\nadjust_text(texts, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-', color='gray', lw=0.5))\n\nax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\nplt.show()\nsns.despine()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](word-bias_files/figure-html/cell-9-output-1.png){}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 672x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n**Indirect Bias:**\n\nThe plot reveals a correlation: words associated with \"softball\" (y-axis > 0) also tend to be associated with \"she\" (x-axis > 0). Conversely, \"football\" terms align with \"he\".\n\nThis suggests that even if we remove explicit gender words, the *structure* of the space still encodes gender through these proxy dimensions.\n:::\n\n\n## Take away\n\n\nWord embeddings, while powerful, inevitably capture and reflect societal biases present in the large text corpora they are trained on. We observed both **direct bias**, where occupations or attributes align strongly with specific gender pronouns, and **indirect bias**, where seemingly neutral concepts become gendered through their associations with other words. This analysis highlights the importance of understanding and mitigating these biases to prevent the perpetuation of stereotypes in AI systems and ensure fairness in applications like search, recommendation, and hiring.\n\n",
