::: {.callout-note title="Your mission"}
You have 60 minutes to transform a terrible visualization into three distinct, honest charts using Python. Then present your redesigns to the class for voting.
:::

## The Challenge

You receive a visualization nightmare (think 3D pie charts, truncated axes, rainbow colors) along with its underlying data. Create three different views using proper visualization principles. Each view should illuminate a different aspect: perhaps distribution, relationships, and composition.

## The Rules

**Time:** 60 minutes of work, followed by presentations.

**Three Distinct Views:** Each visualization must serve a different purpose. No three variations of the same chart type.

**Python Only:** Use matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, or altair for reproducible, code-based visualizations.

**Honest Representation:** Axes must start at meaningful baselines. Colors must enhance understanding. Scales must preserve proportions.

## Evaluation

The class votes on two categories:

**Most Insightful:** Which visualizations reveal something surprising or expose how the original chart misled?

**Best Aesthetic:** Which charts are beautiful, clean, and use color effectively?

## Deliverables

Your submission should include:

1. **Three Visualizations:** Distinct charts addressing different aspects of the data
2. **Code:** Python scripts or notebooks generating the visualizations
3. **Report:** A brief markdown document explaining:
   - What made the original visualization misleading
   - Your design choices for each of the three views
   - Key insights revealed by your visualizations

## Submission

1. Use the provided template: [https://github.com/sk-classroom/sprint-project-template](https://github.com/sk-classroom/sprint-project-template)
2. Follow the template instructions to create your project repository
3. Place your code in the `notebooks` folder
4. Include your visualizations as images in your report
5. Write your report in `README.md`
6. Submit the link to your GitHub repository to Brightspace
