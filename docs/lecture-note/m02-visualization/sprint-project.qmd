title: "Sprint Project: The Ugly Graph Makeover"

::: {.callout-note title="Your mission"}
You have 90 minutes to rescue a data story from a misleading, aesthetically offensive chart. We give you a visualization nightmare. Think 3D pie charts with explosion effects. Think truncated axes that exaggerate differences. Think rainbow color schemes that obscure patterns. Your task is to create three distinct, honest visualizations that reveal the true story hidden in the data. The class votes on "Most Insightful" and "Best Aesthetic" to determine winners.

## The Challenge

Let's talk about why bad visualizations proliferate. They often stem from software defaults, not malice. Excel makes 3D charts easy. PowerPoint encourages flashy effects. Marketing teams demand "exciting" visuals. The result is charts that distort data and mislead audiences.

Your challenge combines critique and creation. You receive a truly terrible visualization along with its underlying data. First, you must identify what makes it misleading. Is the y-axis truncated to amplify small differences? Does the 3D perspective distort proportions? Does the color scheme create false patterns?

Then comes the creative work. You must produce three different views of this data using Python and proper visualization principles. Each view should illuminate a different aspect of the data. Perhaps one view shows distribution, another reveals relationships, and a third highlights composition. Together, these three charts tell a complete, honest story.

## The Rules

**Team Structure:** Work in pairs as Driver and Navigator. Switch every 15 minutes.

**Three Distinct Views:** Your three visualizations must serve different purposes. No three variations of the same bar chart. Think about different questions the data can answer.

**Python Only:** Use matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, or altair. No Excel. No Tableau. The goal is to build reproducible, code-based visualizations.

**Honest Representation:** Your charts must follow principles of truthful visualization. Axes must start at meaningful baselines. Colors must enhance understanding rather than distract. Scales must preserve proportions.

**Time Limit:** 90 minutes from data receipt to final presentation.

## The Workflow

Start by analyzing the bad visualization. List its flaws explicitly. Does it violate any of the principles from this module? Document these problems in a markdown file or notebook cell.

Next, explore the underlying data. Load it in Python. Examine its structure. What variables exist? What relationships might matter? What distributions should you show? This exploration phase guides your visualization choices.

Now plan your three views. Decide what story each will tell. Perhaps you show overall distribution with a histogram, compare groups with a boxplot, and reveal trends with a line chart. Write down your plan before coding.

Implement each visualization methodically. Start with defaults to verify your code works. Then refine aesthetics. Choose appropriate colors. Add clear labels. Ensure scales are honest. Polish until each chart communicates clearly.

Throughout this process, commit regularly to Git. Each completed visualization warrants a commit. Documentation updates deserve commits too.

## What Makes You Win

The class votes based on two criteria, so you can win in two categories.

**Most Insightful:** This award goes to the team whose visualizations reveal something surprising or important about the data. Perhaps you discover a hidden trend. Perhaps you expose how the original chart misled. The judges want to say "I didn't see that until you showed me."

**Best Aesthetic:** This prize recognizes visual excellence. Are your charts beautiful? Do they use color effectively? Are they clean and uncluttered? Do they follow design principles that make data easy to read?

Ideally, your work excels at both. Insight without aesthetics produces ugly truth. Aesthetics without insight produces pretty lies. Strive for beautiful clarity.

## Common Pitfalls

The first trap is mimicking the original chart too closely. Teams sometimes just "fix" the bad chart rather than reimagining the data story. Think bigger. What entirely different views could illuminate this data?

Another mistake is creating three charts that show essentially the same thing. If you make three bar charts with different groupings, you have wasted two opportunities. Each visualization should answer a distinct question.

The third pitfall is neglecting aesthetics in the rush to finish. Teams produce technically correct but visually cluttered charts. Remember that your classmates are voting. Make your visualizations pleasant to look at.

## The Takeaway

This sprint develops your visualization intuition under pressure. You practice diagnosing what makes charts misleading. You learn to consider multiple perspectives on the same data. You build the habit of letting the data guide visualization choices rather than defaulting to familiar chart types.

These skills translate directly to professional work. When your manager shows you a misleading chart in a meeting, you will spot the distortions. When you need to communicate results, you will choose appropriate visual forms. When you present findings, your audience will trust your charts.

Let's transform some ugly graphs into honest, beautiful data stories.
