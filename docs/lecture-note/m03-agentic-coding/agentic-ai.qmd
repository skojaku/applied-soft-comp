**Spoiler**: Agents don't "think" in the human sense. They loop. They are state machines that use an LLM to decide the next transition.

# The Mechanism

The naive view is that agents are "smarter" chatbots. They aren't. They're a core component wrapped in a control loop. A chatbot generates text and stops. An agent generates text, parses it for actionable commands, executes those commands in the real world, observes the results, and feeds those results back into the next prompt. The intelligence doesn't come from the model---it comes from the **feedback loop**.

This is the **ReAct Pattern** (Reason + Act). A standard chatbot is a pure function: $\text{Output} = \text{Model}(\text{Input})$. An agent is a state machine:

```python
while not task_complete:
    observation = get_environment_state()
    thought = model(observation)
    action = parse_action(thought)
    result = execute(action)
    observation = result  # Feedback loop
```

The critical insight is the feedback loop. If the agent tries to import a missing library (Action) and receives `ModuleNotFoundError` (Observation), the next iteration's Thought will be "I need to install this library," rather than hallucinating success. The model corrects itself not through introspection, but through collision with reality.

## How ReAct is implemented

ReAct framework is proposed by [Yao et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629).
The core idea is to prompt the LLM to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner. Specifically, the prompt structure follows a sequence: `Thought` $\rightarrow$ `Action` $\rightarrow$ `Observation`.

1.  **Thought**: The model reasons about the current state and what needs to be done.
2.  **Action**: The model outputs a specific command to interact with an external environment (e.g., `Search[Apple]`).
3.  **Observation**: The environment executes the action and returns the result (e.g., search results for "Apple").

This cycle repeats until the task is solved.

## The Structured Output Problem
Before we can build this loop, we must solve a fundamental engineering problem: **How do we extract executable actions from natural language?**

Think about it: When you ask an LLM "Generate random numbers from a Gaussian distribution", it might respond:

> "I'll generate random numbers for you using a normal distribution."

Early systems used regex to parse the model's output. This failed constantly. The model would say "I'll create random nums" instead of providing structured parameters, and the parser would break. The solution is **Structured Output**---we force the model to return data in a machine-readable format, the most common being **JSON**. For example,

```json
{
    "action": "generate_random",
    "distribution": "gaussian",
    "parameters": {"mean": 0, "std": 1, "size": 100},
    "values": [...]
}
```

So, how can we let LLMs to speak in JSON? The most basic approach is to prompt the model to return JSON. Let's demonstrate with ollama and gemma3:

```{python}
#| echo: false
import ollama
import json

params_llm = {"model": "gemma3n:latest", "options": {"temperature": 0}}
```

```{python}

prompt = """
You are a function-calling assistant. Given a user query, return a JSON object with:
- "action": the name of the function to call
- "parameters": a dictionary of arguments

User query: "Generate 100 random numbers from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1"

Return ONLY valid JSON, no explanation.
"""

response = ollama.generate(prompt=prompt, **params_llm)

print(response.response)
```

The model might return valid JSON, but this is fragile. It might hallucinate extra fields, misspell keys, add conversational text, or return malformed JSON. We need **schema enforcement**.

Modern LLM APIs (including ollama) support **JSON Schema** constraints. You define the shape of the output, and the model is forced to conform:

```{python}
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define the schema using Pydantic
class ToolCall(BaseModel):
    action: str
    parameters: dict
    values: list

# Convert to JSON schema
json_schema = ToolCall.model_json_schema()

# Now constrain the model's output
response = ollama.generate(
    prompt="User query: Generate 50 random numbers from a Gaussian with mean 5 and std 2",
    format=json_schema,  # Schema constraint
    **params_llm
)
```


```{python}
#| code-fold: true
print("Response:")
print(response.response)
```

Now the model cannot hallucinate. It must return valid JSON that matches the schema. If it tries to return `{"acton": ...}` (typo), the generation fails and retries internally.
This is the foundation of reliable agents: **type-safe communication between the LLM and your code**.

## Tool Calling: The Agent's Hands

Structured output tells us what the agent wants to do. **Tool calling** is the mechanism that lets it actually do it.

A **tool** is a function that the agent can invoke. First, define the actual tool function and its schema:

```{python}
import numpy as np

# Define the actual tool function
def generate_random(distribution: str, mean: float = 0, std: float = 1, size: int = 100) -> dict:
    """Generate random numbers from specified distribution"""
    if distribution == "gaussian" or distribution == "normal":
        samples = np.random.normal(loc=mean, scale=std, size=size)
        return {
            "distribution": "gaussian",
            "mean": float(np.mean(samples)),
            "std": float(np.std(samples)),
            "size": len(samples),
            "samples": samples.tolist()[:5]  # Return first 5 for preview
        }
    else:
        return {"error": f"Unknown distribution: {distribution}"}

# Define the tool call schema
class RandomToolCall(BaseModel):
    tool: str
    distribution: str
    mean: float = 0
    std: float = 1
    size: int = 100

tool_schema = RandomToolCall.model_json_schema()
```

Now use ollama to generate tool calls based on user queries:

```{python}
# System prompt that defines the tool
system_prompt = """You are a random number generation assistant. When asked to generate random numbers, respond with a tool call.

Available tool:
- generate_random(distribution: str, mean: float = 0, std: float = 1, size: int = 100) -> dict

Return JSON: {"tool": "generate_random", "distribution": "gaussian", "mean": <value>, "std": <value>, "size": <value>}"""

user_query = "Generate 200 random numbers from a Gaussian distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation 2"

# Generate the tool call
response = ollama.chat(
    model=params_llm["model"],
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_query}
    ],
    format=tool_schema
)

print("LLM Tool Call:")
print(response.message.content)

# Parse and validate
tool_call = RandomToolCall.model_validate_json(response.message.content)
print(f"\nTool: {tool_call.tool}")
print(f"Distribution: {tool_call.distribution}")
print(f"Mean: {tool_call.mean}, Std: {tool_call.std}, Size: {tool_call.size}")
```

The agent doesn't execute the tool—it requests that you execute it. You run the function, capture the result, and feed it back:

```{python}
# Execute the tool
result = generate_random(
    distribution=tool_call.distribution,
    mean=tool_call.mean,
    std=tool_call.std,
    size=tool_call.size
)
print(f"\nTool Execution Result:")
print(f"Generated {result['size']} samples from {result['distribution']} distribution")
print(f"Sample mean: {result['mean']:.2f}, Sample std: {result['std']:.2f}")
print(f"First 5 samples: {result['samples']}")

# Feed the result back to get a natural language response
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a random number generation assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": user_query},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": f"Tool call: {tool_call.model_dump_json()}"},
    {"role": "user", "content": f"Tool result: {json.dumps(result)}. Provide a natural language summary."}
]

final_response = ollama.chat(
    model=params_llm["model"],
    messages=messages
)

print(f"\nFinal Natural Language Response:")
print(final_response.message.content)
```

This is the ReAct loop in action:
1. **Thought**: "I need to call generate_random"
2. **Action**: Tool call request (structured JSON)
3. **Observation**: Tool result (200 samples, mean≈10, std≈2)
4. **Response**: Natural language answer

## The ReAct Framework: Reason + Act

The **ReAct Pattern** formalizes this loop. The agent alternates between **reasoning** (generating thoughts) and **acting** (calling tools or terminating).

Here's a minimal ReAct implementation using ollama:

```{python}
def react_agent_ollama(user_query: str, max_iterations: int = 5) -> str:
    """Simple ReAct agent using ollama and gemma3"""

    system_prompt = """You are a random number generation assistant.

When the user asks to generate random numbers, respond with a tool call:
{"tool": "generate_random", "distribution": "gaussian", "mean": <value>, "std": <value>, "size": <value>}

When you receive tool results, synthesize them into a natural language answer.
If the user asks for multiple distributions or samples, call the tool multiple times."""

    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_query}
    ]

    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        # Generate response
        response = ollama.chat(
            model=params_llm["model"],
            messages=messages,
            format=tool_schema
        )

        content = response.message.content
        print(f"\n--- Iteration {iteration + 1} ---")
        print(f"LLM Output: {content}")

        # Try to parse as tool call
        try:
            tool_call = RandomToolCall.model_validate_json(content)

            # Execute the tool
            result = generate_random(
                distribution=tool_call.distribution,
                mean=tool_call.mean,
                std=tool_call.std,
                size=tool_call.size
            )
            print(f"Tool Executed: generate_random(dist='{tool_call.distribution}', mean={tool_call.mean}, std={tool_call.std}, size={tool_call.size})")
            print(f"Tool Result: {result['size']} samples, mean={result['mean']:.2f}, std={result['std']:.2f}")

            # Add tool call and result to conversation
            messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": content})
            messages.append({
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"Tool result: {json.dumps(result)}. Continue or provide final answer."
            })

        except Exception as e:
            # Not a valid tool call - treat as final answer
            print(f"Final Answer: {content}")
            return content

    return "Max iterations reached"

# Test the agent with multiple requests
print("=" * 60)
print("REACT AGENT TEST: Multiple Random Samples")
print("=" * 60)

final_response = react_agent_ollama("Generate 100 samples with mean 0, std 1, and another 50 samples with mean 10, std 5")
```

The agent will:
1. Call `generate_random(distribution="gaussian", mean=0, std=1, size=100)`
2. Receive the result
3. Call `generate_random(distribution="gaussian", mean=10, std=5, size=50)`
4. Receive the result
5. Synthesize the final answer

This is the entire architecture of Google Antigravity, Claude Code, and Cursor—just scaled with better tools (file editing, terminal commands, web browsing) and better orchestration (parallel agents, verification artifacts).

## Tracing the Agent's Mind

Let's look at a real trace of Gemini 3 solving a problem: "Find the largest file in the current directory."

**Step 1: Thought**
> "I need to list all files and their sizes to determine the largest one. I should use the `ls` command with the `-lh` flag, or better yet, `find` to handle subdirectories."

**Step 2: Action**
> `run_command("find . -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort -rh | head -n 1")`

**Step 3: Observation**
> `105M ./data/large_dataset.csv`

**Step 4: Thought**
> "I have found the file. It is `large_dataset.csv` with a size of 105M. I can now answer the user."

**Step 5: Final Answer**
> "The largest file is `./data/large_dataset.csv` (105MB)."

## The Token Economy

This autonomy comes at a cost.
*   **Latency**: Each step in the loop requires a round-trip to the model. A complex task might take 30 seconds to plan and execute.
*   **Cost**: A simple question might consume 500 tokens. An agentic loop might consume 50,000 tokens as it reads files, gets error messages, and re-reads context.

**Asynchronous Context**
Because of this latency, Antigravity is designed for **Asynchrony**. You don't stare at the cursor waiting for it to move. You assign the task, switch to another file, and wait for the notification. It is a "fire-and-forget" workflow.

# The Takeaway

**Latency is the price of autonomy.** We accept slower individual interactions in exchange for the completion of entire units of work. You trade seconds of waiting for hours of coding.
