**Spoiler**: Agents don't "think" in the human sense. They loop. They are state machines that use an LLM to decide the next transition.

# The Mechanism (Why It Works)

The naive view is that agents are "smarter" chatbots. They aren't. They're dumber chatbots wrapped in a control loop. A chatbot generates text and stops. An agent generates text, parses it for actionable commands, executes those commands in the real world, observes the results, and feeds those results back into the next prompt. The intelligence doesn't come from the model---it comes from the **feedback loop**.

This is the **ReAct Pattern** (Reason + Act). A standard chatbot is a pure function: $\text{Output} = \text{Model}(\text{Input})$. An agent is a state machine:

```python
while not task_complete:
    observation = get_environment_state()
    thought = model(observation)
    action = parse_action(thought)
    result = execute(action)
    observation = result  # Feedback loop
```

The critical insight is the feedback loop. If the agent tries to import a missing library (Action) and receives `ModuleNotFoundError` (Observation), the next iteration's Thought will be "I need to install this library," rather than hallucinating success. The model corrects itself not through introspection, but through collision with reality.

## The Structured Output Problem

Before we can build this loop, we must solve a fundamental engineering problem: **How do we extract executable actions from natural language?**

When you ask an LLM "What's the weather?", it might respond:
> "Let me check the weather for you. I'll use the weather API."

This is useless. We need:
```json
{"action": "call_api", "api_name": "weather", "parameters": {"location": "New York"}}
```

Early systems used regex to parse the model's output. This failed constantly. The model would say "I'll check the weather in NYC" instead of "New York," and the parser would break. The solution is **Structured Output**—we force the model to return data in a machine-readable format.

# The Application (How We Use It)

## Structured Output with JSON Schema

The most basic approach is to prompt the model to return JSON. Let's demonstrate with ollama and gemma3:

```{python}
import ollama
import json

prompt = """
You are a function-calling assistant. Given a user query, return a JSON object with:
- "action": the name of the function to call
- "parameters": a dictionary of arguments

User query: "What's the weather in Tokyo?"

Return ONLY valid JSON, no explanation.
"""

params_llm = {"model": "gemma3n:latest", "options": {"temperature": 0}}
response = ollama.generate(prompt=prompt, **params_llm)

print("Raw LLM Response:")
print(response.response)
```

The model might return valid JSON, but this is fragile. It might hallucinate extra fields, misspell keys, add conversational text, or return malformed JSON. We need **schema enforcement**.

Modern LLM APIs (including ollama) support **JSON Schema** constraints. You define the shape of the output, and the model is forced to conform:

```{python}
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define the schema using Pydantic
class ToolCall(BaseModel):
    action: str
    parameters: dict

# Convert to JSON schema
json_schema = ToolCall.model_json_schema()

# Now constrain the model's output
response = ollama.generate(
    prompt="User query: What's the weather in Tokyo?",
    format=json_schema,  # Schema constraint
    **params_llm
)

print("\nSchema-Constrained Response:")
print(response.response)

# Validate the output
tool_call = ToolCall.model_validate_json(response.response)
print(f"\nValidated action: {tool_call.action}")
print(f"Validated parameters: {tool_call.parameters}")
```

Now the model cannot hallucinate. It must return valid JSON that matches the schema. If it tries to return `{"acton": ...}` (typo), the generation fails and retries internally.

## Pydantic: Python's Type System for Data

Writing raw JSON schemas is verbose and error-prone. **Pydantic** solves this by letting you define schemas as Python classes with type annotations:

```{python}
from pydantic import BaseModel

class WeatherRequest(BaseModel):
    action: str
    location: str
    units: str = "celsius"  # Default value

# Validation happens automatically
request = WeatherRequest(action="get_weather", location="Tokyo")
print("Valid request:")
print(request.model_dump_json())
print()

# Invalid data raises an error
try:
    invalid = WeatherRequest(action="get_weather")  # Missing 'location'
except Exception as e:
    print("Validation error:")
    print(f"  {type(e).__name__}: {str(e)[:80]}...")
```

Pydantic integrates directly with ollama. You pass the Pydantic model's JSON schema, and ollama generates constrained output:

```{python}
# Define a more specific schema for weather queries
class WeatherQuery(BaseModel):
    location: str
    units: str = "celsius"

# Get the JSON schema
weather_schema = WeatherQuery.model_json_schema()

# Use it to constrain ollama's output
response = ollama.generate(
    prompt="Extract the location from: What's the weather in Tokyo?",
    format=weather_schema,
    **params_llm
)

print("LLM Response:")
print(response.response)

# Parse and validate
query = WeatherQuery.model_validate_json(response.response)
print(f"\nExtracted location: {query.location}")
print(f"Units: {query.units}")
```

This is the foundation of reliable agents: **type-safe communication between the LLM and your code**.

## Tool Calling: The Agent's Hands

Structured output tells us what the agent wants to do. **Tool calling** is the mechanism that lets it actually do it.

A **tool** is a function that the agent can invoke. First, define the actual tool function and its schema:

```{python}
# Define the actual tool function
def get_weather(location: str, units: str = "celsius") -> dict:
    """Simulated weather API"""
    mock_data = {
        "Berlin": {"temperature": 15, "condition": "cloudy"},
        "Tokyo": {"temperature": 22, "condition": "rainy"},
        "Paris": {"temperature": 18, "condition": "sunny"}
    }
    return mock_data.get(location, {"temperature": None, "condition": "unknown"})

# Define the tool call schema
class WeatherToolCall(BaseModel):
    tool: str
    location: str
    units: str = "celsius"

tool_schema = WeatherToolCall.model_json_schema()
```

Now use ollama to generate tool calls based on user queries:

```{python}
# System prompt that defines the tool
system_prompt = """You are a weather assistant. When asked about weather, respond with a tool call.

Available tool:
- get_weather(location: str, units: str = "celsius") -> dict

Return JSON: {"tool": "get_weather", "location": "<city>", "units": "celsius"}"""

user_query = "What's the weather in Berlin?"

# Generate the tool call
response = ollama.chat(
    model=params_llm["model"],
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_query}
    ],
    format=tool_schema
)

print("LLM Tool Call:")
print(response.message.content)

# Parse and validate
tool_call = WeatherToolCall.model_validate_json(response.message.content)
print(f"\nTool: {tool_call.tool}")
print(f"Location: {tool_call.location}")
print(f"Units: {tool_call.units}")
```

The agent doesn't execute the tool—it requests that you execute it. You run the function, capture the result, and feed it back:

```{python}
# Execute the tool
result = get_weather(location=tool_call.location, units=tool_call.units)
print(f"\nTool Execution Result:")
print(result)

# Feed the result back to get a natural language response
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a weather assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": user_query},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": f"Tool call: {tool_call.model_dump_json()}"},
    {"role": "user", "content": f"Tool result: {json.dumps(result)}. Provide a natural language answer."}
]

final_response = ollama.chat(
    model=params_llm["model"],
    messages=messages
)

print(f"\nFinal Natural Language Response:")
print(final_response.message.content)
```

This is the ReAct loop in action:
1. **Thought**: "I need to call get_weather"
2. **Action**: Tool call request (structured JSON)
3. **Observation**: Tool result (15°C, cloudy)
4. **Response**: Natural language answer

## The ReAct Framework: Reason + Act

The **ReAct Pattern** formalizes this loop. The agent alternates between **reasoning** (generating thoughts) and **acting** (calling tools or terminating).

Here's a minimal ReAct implementation using ollama:

```{python}
def react_agent_ollama(user_query: str, max_iterations: int = 5) -> str:
    """Simple ReAct agent using ollama and gemma3"""

    system_prompt = """You are a weather assistant.

When the user asks about weather, respond with a tool call:
{"tool": "get_weather", "location": "<city>", "units": "celsius"}

When you receive tool results, synthesize them into a natural language answer.
If the user asks about multiple locations, call the tool multiple times."""

    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_query}
    ]

    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        # Generate response
        response = ollama.chat(
            model=params_llm["model"],
            messages=messages,
            format=tool_schema
        )

        content = response.message.content
        print(f"\n--- Iteration {iteration + 1} ---")
        print(f"LLM Output: {content}")

        # Try to parse as tool call
        try:
            tool_call = WeatherToolCall.model_validate_json(content)

            # Execute the tool
            result = get_weather(location=tool_call.location, units=tool_call.units)
            print(f"Tool Executed: get_weather(location='{tool_call.location}')")
            print(f"Tool Result: {result}")

            # Add tool call and result to conversation
            messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": content})
            messages.append({
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"Tool result: {json.dumps(result)}. Continue or provide final answer."
            })

        except Exception as e:
            # Not a valid tool call - treat as final answer
            print(f"Final Answer: {content}")
            return content

    return "Max iterations reached"

# Test the agent with multiple locations
print("=" * 60)
print("REACT AGENT TEST: Multiple Locations")
print("=" * 60)

final_response = react_agent_ollama("What's the weather in Paris and Tokyo?")
```

The agent will:
1. Call `get_weather(location="Paris")`
2. Receive the result
3. Call `get_weather(location="Tokyo")`
4. Receive the result
5. Synthesize the final answer

This is the entire architecture of Google Antigravity, Claude Code, and Cursor—just scaled with better tools (file editing, terminal commands, web browsing) and better orchestration (parallel agents, verification artifacts).

## Tracing the Agent's Mind

Let's look at a real trace of Gemini 3 solving a problem: "Find the largest file in the current directory."

**Step 1: Thought**
> "I need to list all files and their sizes to determine the largest one. I should use the `ls` command with the `-lh` flag, or better yet, `find` to handle subdirectories."

**Step 2: Action**
> `run_command("find . -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort -rh | head -n 1")`

**Step 3: Observation**
> `105M ./data/large_dataset.csv`

**Step 4: Thought**
> "I have found the file. It is `large_dataset.csv` with a size of 105M. I can now answer the user."

**Step 5: Final Answer**
> "The largest file is `./data/large_dataset.csv` (105MB)."

## The Token Economy

This autonomy comes at a cost.
*   **Latency**: Each step in the loop requires a round-trip to the model. A complex task might take 30 seconds to plan and execute.
*   **Cost**: A simple question might consume 500 tokens. An agentic loop might consume 50,000 tokens as it reads files, gets error messages, and re-reads context.

**Asynchronous Context**
Because of this latency, Antigravity is designed for **Asynchrony**. You don't stare at the cursor waiting for it to move. You assign the task, switch to another file, and wait for the notification. It is a "fire-and-forget" workflow.

# The Takeaway

**Latency is the price of autonomy.** We accept slower individual interactions in exchange for the completion of entire units of work. You trade seconds of waiting for hours of coding.
