**Spoiler**: Agents don't "think" in the human sense. They loop. They are state machines that use an LLM to decide the next transition.

# The Mechanism

The naive view is that agents are "smarter" chatbots. They aren't. They're a core component wrapped in a control loop. A chatbot generates text and stops. An agent generates text, parses it for actionable commands, executes those commands in the real world, observes the results, and feeds those results back into the next prompt. The intelligence doesn't come from the model---it comes from the **feedback loop**.

This is the **ReAct Pattern** (Reason + Act). A standard chatbot is a pure function: $\text{Output} = \text{Model}(\text{Input})$. An agent is a state machine:

```python
while not task_complete:
    observation = get_environment_state()
    thought = model(observation)
    action = parse_action(thought)
    result = execute(action)
    observation = result  # Feedback loop
```

The critical insight is the feedback loop. If the agent tries to import a missing library (Action) and receives `ModuleNotFoundError` (Observation), the next iteration's Thought will be "I need to install this library," rather than hallucinating success. The model corrects itself not through introspection, but through collision with reality.

## How ReAct is implemented

ReAct framework is proposed by [Yao et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629).
The core idea is to prompt the LLM to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner. Specifically, the prompt structure follows a sequence: `Thought` $\rightarrow$ `Action` $\rightarrow$ `Observation`.

1.  **Thought**: The model reasons about the current state and what needs to be done.
2.  **Action**: The model outputs a specific command to interact with an external environment (e.g., `Search[Apple]`).
3.  **Observation**: The environment executes the action and returns the result (e.g., search results for "Apple").

This cycle repeats until the task is solved.

## The Structured Output Problem

![](../figs/structured-output-manga.png){width="70%" fig-align="center"}

Before we can build this loop, we must solve a fundamental engineering problem: **How do we extract executable actions from natural language?**

Think about it: When you ask an LLM "Generate random numbers from a Gaussian distribution", it might respond:

> "I'll generate random numbers for you using a normal distribution."

Early systems used regex to parse the model's output. This failed constantly. The model would say "I'll create random nums" instead of providing structured parameters, and the parser would break. The solution is **Structured Output**---we force the model to return data in a machine-readable format, the most common being **JSON**. For example,

```json
{
    "action": "generate_random",
    "distribution": "gaussian",
    "parameters": {"mean": 0, "std": 1, "size": 100},
    "values": [...]
}
```

So, how can we let LLMs to speak in JSON? The most basic approach is to prompt the model to return JSON. Let's demonstrate with ollama and gpt-oss 120b:

::: {.column-margin}

We will use `gpt-oss:120b-cloud` as the LLM. This is a 120B parameter model that is hosted by Ollama. See [Ollama Cloud](https://ollama.com/cloud) for more details.

:::

```{python}
#| echo: false
import ollama
import json

params_llm = {"model": "gpt-oss:120b-cloud", "options": {"temperature": 0.3}}
```

```{python}

prompt = """
You are a function-calling assistant. Given a user query, return a JSON object with:
- "action": the name of the function to call
- "parameters": a dictionary of arguments
- "values": the result of the function call

User query: "Generate 30 random numbers from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1"

Return ONLY valid JSON, no explanation.
"""

response = ollama.generate(prompt=prompt, **params_llm)

print(response.response)
```

The model might return valid JSON, but this is fragile. It might hallucinate extra fields, misspell keys, add conversational text, or return malformed JSON. We need **schema enforcement**.

Modern LLM APIs (including ollama) support **JSON Schema** constraints. You define the shape of the output, and the model is forced to conform:

```{python}
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define the schema using Pydantic
class ToolCall(BaseModel):
    action: str
    parameters: dict
    values: list[float]

# Convert to JSON schema
json_schema = ToolCall.model_json_schema()

# Now constrain the model's output
response = ollama.generate(
    prompt="User query: Generate 30 random numbers from a Gaussian with mean 5 and std 2",
    format=json_schema,  # Schema constraint
    **params_llm
)
```


```{python}
#| code-fold: true
print("Response:")
print(response.response)
```

Now the model cannot hallucinate. It must return valid JSON that matches the schema. If it tries to return `{"acton": ...}` (typo), the generation fails and retries internally.
This is the foundation of reliable agents: **type-safe communication between the LLM and your code**.

## The ReAct Framework with `smolagents`

The **ReAct Pattern** formalizes this loop. The agent alternates between **reasoning** (generating thoughts) and **acting** (calling tools or terminating).

Rather than building our own agent framework from scratch, we can use **`smolagents`** from Hugging Face—a lightweight library that implements the ReAct pattern with support for multiple LLM backends including local models via ollama.

Install smolagents:

```bash
pip install smolagents
```

### Creating a Tool

A tool is a Python class that wraps a function the agent can call. Let's create `GenerateRandomTool` to understand the anatomy:

::: {.column-margin}
**Tool**: Base class from smolagents. All custom tools inherit from this.

**forward()**: The execution method. Named after PyTorch convention—the agent calls this with LLM-generated parameters.
:::

```{python}
from smolagents import Tool, CodeAgent, LiteLLMModel
import numpy as np
import json

class GenerateRandomTool(Tool):
    name = "generate_random"
    description = "Generates random numbers from a Gaussian distribution"
    inputs = {
        "mean": {"type": "number", "description": "Mean of the distribution", "nullable": True},
        "std": {"type": "number", "description": "Standard deviation", "nullable": True},
        "size": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of samples", "nullable": True}
    }
    output_type = "string"

    def forward(self, mean: float = 0, std: float = 1, size: int = 100) -> str:
        samples = np.random.normal(loc=mean, scale=std, size=size)
        return f"Generated {size} samples: mean={np.mean(samples):.2f}, std={np.std(samples):.2f}"
```

The structure is fixed. Every tool must define:

1. **`name`**: Identifier the agent uses to call this tool (must be unique)
2. **`description`**: What the LLM reads to decide when to use this tool
3. **`inputs`**: JSON schema with `type`, `description`, and optionally `nullable` for each parameter
4. **`output_type`**: Return type (usually `"string"`)
5. **`forward()`**: The actual execution logic that runs when the agent calls the tool

Now define two more tools using the same pattern:

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
class CalculateStatsTool(Tool):
    name = "calculate_statistics"
    description = "Calculates statistics from a list of numbers"
    inputs = {
        "data": {"type": "string", "description": "JSON array of numbers"}
    }
    output_type = "string"

    def forward(self, data: str) -> str:
        arr = np.array(json.loads(data))
        return f"mean={np.mean(arr):.2f}, std={np.std(arr):.2f}, median={np.median(arr):.2f}"

class FitDistributionTool(Tool):
    name = "fit_distribution"
    description = "Fits a Gaussian distribution to observed data"
    inputs = {
        "data": {"type": "string", "description": "JSON array of observed values"}
    }
    output_type = "string"

    def forward(self, data: str) -> str:
        arr = np.array(json.loads(data))
        return f"Fitted Gaussian: mean={np.mean(arr):.2f}, std={np.std(arr):.2f}"
```

Create the agent with our tools:

::: {.column-margin}
**CodeAgent**: The agent orchestrator that implements the ReAct loop. It takes tools, an LLM, and a step limit.

**max_steps**: Maximum ReAct iterations before terminating. Prevents infinite loops.
:::


```{python}
# Initialize the agent with ollama backend
from smolagents import LiteLLMModel

# Use ollama through LiteLLM
model_name = "ollama/gpt-oss:120b-cloud"  # LiteLLM requires "ollama/" prefix
model = LiteLLMModel(model_id=model_name, api_base="http://localhost:11434")

# Create the agent with our tools
agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[GenerateRandomTool(), CalculateStatsTool(), FitDistributionTool()],
    model=model,
    max_steps=5
)
```

Run the agent on different queries and watch it choose the right tool:

```{python}
queries = [
    "Generate 30 random numbers from a Gaussian distribution with mean 10 and std 2",
    "I have this data: [1.5, 2.3, 1.8, 2.1, 1.9]. Calculate statistics for it.",
    "I measured these values: [5.2, 5.1, 4.9, 5.3, 5.0]. Fit a Gaussian distribution to this data."
]

for i, query in enumerate(queries, 1):
    print(f"\n{'='*60}")
    print(f"QUERY {i}: {query}")
    print('='*60)

    result = agent.run(query)
    print(f"\nAgent Response: {result}")
```

Watch the agent's reasoning trace by enabling verbose logging:

```{python}
# Enable verbose logging to see the ReAct loop
from smolagents import LogLevel

agent.logger.level = LogLevel.DEBUG  # Enable detailed trace output

query = "Generate 100 samples with mean 0, std 1, then calculate statistics on those samples"

print("=" * 60)
print("REACT TRACE: Multi-Step Task")
print("=" * 60)

result = agent.run(query)

print(f"\nFinal Answer: {result}")
```

The agent will:
1. **Thought**: "I need to generate random numbers first"
2. **Action**: Call `generate_random(mean=0, std=1, size=100)`
3. **Observation**: Receive the generated samples
4. **Thought**: "Now I need to calculate statistics on these samples"
5. **Action**: Call `calculate_statistics(data=[...])`
6. **Observation**: Receive the statistics
7. **Response**: Synthesize natural language answer

This is the entire architecture of Google Antigravity, Claude Code, and Cursor—just scaled with better tools (file editing, terminal commands, web browsing) and better orchestration (parallel agents, verification artifacts).

## Tracing the Agent's Mind

Let's look at a real trace of Gemini 3 solving a problem: "Find the largest file in the current directory."

**Step 1: Thought**
> "I need to list all files and their sizes to determine the largest one. I should use the `ls` command with the `-lh` flag, or better yet, `find` to handle subdirectories."

**Step 2: Action**
> `run_command("find . -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort -rh | head -n 1")`

**Step 3: Observation**
> `105M ./data/large_dataset.csv`

**Step 4: Thought**
> "I have found the file. It is `large_dataset.csv` with a size of 105M. I can now answer the user."

**Step 5: Final Answer**
> "The largest file is `./data/large_dataset.csv` (105MB)."

## The Token Economy

This autonomy comes at a cost.
*   **Latency**: Each step in the loop requires a round-trip to the model. A complex task might take 30 seconds to plan and execute.
*   **Cost**: A simple question might consume 500 tokens. An agentic loop might consume 50,000 tokens as it reads files, gets error messages, and re-reads context.

**Asynchronous Context**
Because of this latency, Antigravity is designed for **Asynchrony**. You don't stare at the cursor waiting for it to move. You assign the task, switch to another file, and wait for the notification. It is a "fire-and-forget" workflow.

# The Takeaway

**Latency is the price of autonomy.** We accept slower individual interactions in exchange for the completion of entire units of work. You trade seconds of waiting for hours of coding.
