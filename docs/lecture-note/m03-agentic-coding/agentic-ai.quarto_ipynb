An agent generates text, parses it for actionable commands, executes those commands in the real world, observes the results, and feeds those results back into the next prompt. The intelligence doesn't come from the model---it comes from the **feedback loop**.\n",

The model corrects itself not through introspection, but through collision with reality.\n",
