## Course Overview

This course explores how deep learning serves as a powerful tool to operationalize high-dimensional data from social and physical systems. You'll learn to model complex system dynamics using modern computational intelligence, and in turn, use perspectives from complexity science to understand the emergent behaviors of large-scale models.

The course combines:

- **Hands-on coding** with real data from text, images, and networks
- **Theoretical foundations** of deep learning and complex systems
- **Reproducible data science practices** with modern tools
- **Ethical considerations** in AI and computational modeling
