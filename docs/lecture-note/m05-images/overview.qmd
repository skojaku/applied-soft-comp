## The Journey

Let's talk about where this module takes you. We begin with the fundamentals and build up to cutting-edge architectures. Each part answers a crucial question.

**[Part 1: Understanding Images](01-what-is-an-image.qmd)**

Before we can process images with neural networks, we need to understand what images are. How do computers represent visual information? Why does spatial structure matter?

We answer these questions by examining images as multidimensional arrays.

**[Part 2: The Deep Learning Revolution](02-the-deep-learning-revolution.qmd)**

Computer vision didn't always work this way. Shift your attention to the historical moment when neural networks transformed the field.

We contrast the old paradigm of hand-crafted features with learned representations, following the path from LeNet to AlexNet's breakthrough.

**[Part 3: Becoming a Practitioner](03-using-cnn-models.qmd)**

Now you'll learn the skills to actually use these models. We cover CNN building blocks like convolution and pooling.

You'll work with pre-trained models and master transfer learning. By the end, you'll have hands-on implementation experience.

**[Part 4: The Innovation Timeline](04-cnn-innovations.qmd)**

The very best way to understand modern architectures is to see them as solutions to specific problems. Why did networks need to get deeper? How did researchers overcome training difficulties?

We trace the quest for better networks through VGG, Inception, ResNet, and Vision Transformers.

## Why This Matters

Here's something remarkable. Computer vision is no longer about manually designing features. Modern systems learn representations automatically from data.

This shift changed everything about how we build vision applications. What used to require expert knowledge and careful tuning now happens through learning.

This module gives you both conceptual understanding and practical skills. You'll know why architectures evolved the way they did. You'll also be able to use state-of-the-art vision models in your own projects.

## Prerequisites

You should be comfortable with basic Python programming and NumPy arrays. Neural network fundamentals matter here: forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent.

You'll also need PyTorch basics like tensors, autograd, and simple model training. If you need to refresh these topics, review the earlier modules in this course.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this module, you will understand how images are represented as tensors. You'll implement classic CNN architectures from scratch.

You'll use pre-trained models for transfer learning. You'll make informed decisions about architecture selection. Most importantly, you'll gain practical hands-on experience with real vision models.

Let's begin by understanding what an image really is.
