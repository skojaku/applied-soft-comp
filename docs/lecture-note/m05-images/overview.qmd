::: {.callout-note title="What you'll learn in this module"}
This module takes you from pixels to state-of-the-art vision models. We start by understanding images as data structures, explore the paradigm shift from hand-crafted to learned features, learn practical skills for using CNNs, and trace the innovation timeline from VGG to Vision Transformers.

## The Journey

**Part 1: Understanding Images**

Before we can process images with neural networks, we need to understand what images are. We examine how computers represent visual information and why spatial structure matters.

**Part 2: The Deep Learning Revolution**

Shift your attention to the historical moment when neural networks transformed computer vision. We contrast hand-crafted features with learned representations, following the path from LeNet to AlexNet.

**Part 3: Becoming a Practitioner**

Now you'll learn the skills to actually use these models. We cover CNN building blocks, pre-trained models, transfer learning, and hands-on implementation.

**Part 4: The Innovation Timeline**

The very best way to understand modern architectures is to see them as solutions to specific problems. We trace the quest for deeper, more efficient networks through VGG, Inception, ResNet, and Vision Transformers.

## Why This Matters

Computer vision is no longer about manually designing features. Modern systems learn representations automatically from data. This module gives you both conceptual understanding and practical skills to work with state-of-the-art vision models.

## Prerequisites

You should be comfortable with basic Python programming and NumPy arrays. You'll also need neural network fundamentals like forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent. Finally, PyTorch basics matter here: tensors, autograd, and simple model training.

If you need to refresh these topics, review the earlier modules in this course.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this module, you will understand how images are represented as tensors. You'll implement classic CNN architectures from scratch and use pre-trained models for transfer learning. You'll make informed decisions about architecture selection and gain practical hands-on experience with real vision models.

Let's begin by understanding what an image really is.
