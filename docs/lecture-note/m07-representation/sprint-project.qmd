title: "Sprint Project: The Les Misérables Identity Crisis"
---

::: {.callout-note title="Your mission"}
You have 60 minutes to create two rival embeddings of *Les Misérables* characters—one semantic (from text), one structural (from co-occurrence network)—and find the biggest "reputation gaps." Then present your discoveries to the class for voting.
:::

## The Challenge

You receive the full text of *Les Misérables* and a character co-occurrence network. Create semantic embeddings using text-based methods (Word2Vec, BERT, etc.) and structural embeddings using graph methods (Node2Vec, DeepWalk). Compare nearest neighbors in both spaces. Find characters whose textual associations differ drastically from their network position. Who is Valjean close to in narrative versus structure?

## The Rules

**Time:** 60 minutes of work, followed by presentations.

**Two Embeddings Required:** Generate both semantic (text-based) and structural (graph-based) embeddings. Document methods used.

**Same Characters:** Use consistent character sets in both embedding spaces to enable comparison.

**Identity Crisis Discovery:** Identify at least three characters with significant discrepancies. Quantify using Jaccard distance or correlation.

## Evaluation

The class votes on the most compelling reputation gap:

**Magnitude (30%):** How large is the discrepancy between neighborhoods?

**Interpretability (40%):** Does the gap illuminate something true about the character's dual roles?

**Presentation (30%):** Clear explanations with effective visualizations (e.g., 2D projections with lines connecting positions).

## Deliverables

Your submission should include:

1. **Embeddings:** Both semantic and structural embeddings for characters
2. **Analysis Code:** Script or notebook computing and comparing embeddings
3. **Visualizations:** 2D projections showing both spaces with gap illustrations
4. **Report:** A brief markdown document explaining:
   - Embedding methods used for each space
   - Three characters with significant reputation gaps
   - Interpretation of what these gaps reveal about the story
