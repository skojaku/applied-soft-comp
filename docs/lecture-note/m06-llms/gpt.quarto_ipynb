        "\n",
        "**Greedy sampling** always picks the highest probability token, which is deterministic but can lead to repetitive or trapped text. For example, if the model predicts \"the\" with high probability, it will always predict \"the\" again.\n",

For example, in generating \"The cat ran across the ___\", beam search might preserve a path containing \"mat\" even if \"floor\" or \"room\" have higher individual probabilities at that position. This is because the complete sequence like \"mat quickly\" could be more probable when considering the token next after \"mat\".  \"The cat ran across the mat quickly\" is a more natural phrase than \"The cat ran across the floor quickly\" when considering the full flow and common linguistic patterns.\n",

It samples from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds a threshold p (e.g. 0.9). This adapts naturally to different probability distributions, i.e., selecting few tokens when the distribution is concentrated and more when it's spread out. This approach often provides a good balance between quality and diversity.\n",
