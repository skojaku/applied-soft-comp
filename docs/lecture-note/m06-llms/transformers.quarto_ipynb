        "## The Mechanism\n",
        "\n",
        "You've been taught to think of language models as sequential processors—reading left to right, one word triggering the next, like dominoes falling. This intuition comes from recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where information flows step by step, each word depending on the hidden state from the previous word. The transformer architecture throws this away entirely.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of sequential processing, transformers operate through **parallel relationship mapping**. When you read \"The cat sat on the mat because it was tired,\" you don't actually process word-by-word in isolation. Your brain simultaneously evaluates which words relate to which—\"it\" connects to \"cat,\" \"tired\" explains \"sat,\" \"mat\" anchors \"on.\" Transformers formalize this intuition mathematically. Every position in the input sequence simultaneously computes its relationship to every other position. The mechanism is attention, and the result is a system where context flows in all directions at once, not just forward through time.\n",
        "\n",
        "This parallelism is why transformers scaled when RNNs didn't. Recurrent architectures impose sequential computation—you can't process word 100 until you've processed word 99. Transformers eliminate this bottleneck. Every position can be computed in parallel, which means training time scales with sequence complexity, not sequence length. This architectural shift is what enabled GPT-3, GPT-4, and Claude to exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "Modern LLMs stack multiple **transformer blocks**—modular units that take a sequence of token vectors as input and output a transformed sequence of the same length. GPT-3 uses 96 of these blocks; GPT-4 likely uses more. Each block refines the representation, adding layers of contextual understanding.\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "These blocks come in two forms: **encoders** and **decoders**. The encoder processes the input sequence and builds a contextualized representation. The decoder generates the output sequence, attending to both its own previous outputs and the encoder's representation. For translation tasks (\"I love you\" → \"Je t'aime\"), the encoder processes English, the decoder generates French. For language modeling (GPT-style systems), only the decoder is used—it generates text autoregressively, predicting the next token based on all previous tokens.\n",

        "**Self-attention**—the core of the transformer—computes how much each position in a sequence should \"attend to\" every other position. Unlike earlier attention mechanisms in seq2seq models, which attended from one sentence to another, self-attention operates within a single sequence. It answers the question: \"Given this word, which other words matter most?\"\n",

When you search for \"machine learning\" (your query), you match it against book titles (keys) to find relevant content (values).\n",

The attention mechanism then computes which keys are most relevant to each query using the dot product, which measures vector similarity. The dot product $QK^T$ produces a matrix of attention scores—large values indicate strong relationships, small values indicate weak ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "These raw scores are scaled by $\\sqrt{d_k}$ (the square root of the key dimension) to prevent extreme values, then normalized using softmax to produce a probability distribution. Finally, these normalized attention weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the value vectors. The complete operation is:\n",
