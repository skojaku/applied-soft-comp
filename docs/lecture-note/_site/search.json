    "text": "The Day the Code Disappeared\nPicture this: you’re working late on a project, you’ve finally fixed a major bug, and you’re about to go home. You close your laptop, and the next morning, you open it up to find that all your changes from the previous day are gone. Your heart sinks. You have no idea what you did to fix the bug, and you have to start all over again.\nEven the pros can make mistakes. In 2017, GitLab, a major code hosting platform, suffered a catastrophic outage. A system administrator accidentally deleted a massive amount of production data, and the backups… well, they didn’t work as expected. The company lost six hours of customer data, a lifetime in the fast-paced world of software development.\n\n\nYou can read the full, cringe-worthy post-mortem on the GitLab blog.\n\n\nWe accidentally deleted production data and might have to restore from backup. Google Doc with live notes https://t.co/EVRbHzYlk8\n\n— GitLab.com Status ((gitlabstatus?)) February 1, 2017\n\n\n\n\nVersion Control\nVersion control is a very important part of any data-related work. A version control system (VCS) saves “snapshots” of your files. The most popular system today is Git, and when you put Git in the cloud (like on GitHub), you can access your work from anywhere, share it, and even show it off.\n\n\n\n\nThe following blog is a good minimal documentation about git and github.\n\nA layman’s introduction to Git\n\nYou can also test your understanding of Git and GitHub with the following interactive tutorial:\n\nInteractive Git Tutorial - Visual, hands-on learning\n\nFor more comprehensive documentation, you can refer to the following resources:\n\nGit Documentation\nAtlassian Git Tutorials - Detailed tutorials with examples\n\nAnd I recommend the beginners to start with GitHub Desktop, instead of command line, to manage your Git repositories.\n\nGitHub Desktop Documentation - Official desktop app guide",

You’ll learn to model complex system dynamics using modern computational intelligence, and in turn, use perspectives from complexity science to understand the emergent behaviors of large-scale models.\nThe course combines:\n\nHands-on coding with real data from text, images, and networks\nTheoretical foundations of deep learning and complex systems\nReproducible data science practices with modern tools\nEthical considerations in AI and computational modeling",
