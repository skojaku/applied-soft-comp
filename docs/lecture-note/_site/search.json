    "text": "Course Overview\nThis course explores how deep learning serves as a powerful tool to operationalize high-dimensional data from social and physical systems. You’ll learn to model complex system dynamics using modern computational intelligence, and in turn, use perspectives from complexity science to understand the emergent behaviors of large-scale models.\nThe course combines:\n\nHands-on coding with real data from text, images, and networks\nTheoretical foundations of deep learning and complex systems\nReproducible data science practices with modern tools\nEthical considerations in AI and computational modeling",
