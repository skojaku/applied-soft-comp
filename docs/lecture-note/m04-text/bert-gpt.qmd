BERT and GPT are not variants of one architecture. They represent fundamentally different information flows: BERT reads the entire sentence at once for deep understanding, while GPT processes sequentially for text generation. Understanding this distinction shapes how you choose the right model for your task.

## Two Siblings, BERT and GPT

We instinctively think of "Transformers" as a single unified model, but this is wrong. The original Transformer paper proposed an Encoder-Decoder architecture, a two-part machine. Modern models split this architecture in half, creating two distinct lineages with fundamentally different information flows. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) uses the encoder stack and sees everything at once, like reading a completed sentence. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) uses the decoder stack and processes text causally, like improvising a story where you can only react to what's already been said. This architectural choice isn't cosmetic. It determines what the model can learn and what tasks it excels at.

Think of it like two different reading strategies. BERT is the student who reads the entire paragraph, then goes back to understand each word in context. GPT is the actor performing a cold read, processing each line sequentially without peeking ahead at the script. The first strategy gives you deeper understanding; the second gives you the ability to continue the story.

## Architecture

Perhaps the most important difference between BERT and GPT is the attention mechanism. BERT uses bidirectional attention, meaning every token at position $t$ can attend to every other token. This allows BERT to understand the context of a word by looking at all the words in the sentence, not just the ones before it, helping it capture the full context of a token.

GPT uses masked (or causal) attention, meaning a token at position $t$ can only attend to previous tokens. This masking imposes a causal constraint, making it ideal for tasks like language generation where the model must predict future tokens based only on past context. Although GPT's attention is not bidirectional and thus less globally context-aware than BERT's, this causal processing allows it to generate remarkably fluent and coherent text sequentially.

### More on BERT

BERT uses several special tokens to represent the input sentence. The [CLS] token is used to represent the start of the sentence. The [SEP] token is used to represent the end of the sentence. The [MASK] token is used to represent masked words. The [UNK] token is used to represent unknown words. For example, the sentence "The cat sat on the mat. It then went to sleep." is represented as "[CLS] The cat sat on the mat [SEP] It then went to sleep [SEP]".

In BERT, the [CLS] token is used to classify the input sentences. As a result, the model learns to encode a summary of the input sentence into the [CLS] token, which is particularly useful when we want the embedding of the whole input text, instead of the token level embeddings.

BERT uses position and segment embeddings to provide the model with information about the position of the tokens in the sequence. Position embeddings provide information about the position of tokens in the sequence. Unlike the sinusoidal position embedding used in the original transformer paper, BERT uses learnable position embeddings. Segment embeddings distinguish the sentences in the input. For example, for the sentence "The cat sat on the mat. It then went to sleep.", the tokens in the first sentence are added with segment embedding 0, and the tokens in the second sentence are added with segment embedding 1. These segment embeddings are also learned during the pre-training process.

Several BERT variants have been developed. RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach) improved upon BERT through several optimizations: removing the Next Sentence Prediction task, using dynamic masking that changes the mask patterns across training epochs, training with larger batches, and using a larger dataset. These changes led to significant performance improvements while maintaining BERT's core architecture.

DistilBERT focused on making BERT more efficient through knowledge distillation, where a smaller student model learns from the larger BERT teacher model. It achieves 95% of BERT's performance while being 40% smaller and 60% faster, making it more suitable for resource-constrained environments and real-world applications.

ALBERT introduced parameter reduction techniques to address BERT's memory limitations. It uses factorized embedding parameterization and cross-layer parameter sharing to dramatically reduce parameters while maintaining performance. ALBERT also replaced Next Sentence Prediction with Sentence Order Prediction, where the model must determine if two consecutive sentences are in the correct order.

Domain-specific BERT models have been trained on specialized corpora to better handle specific fields. Examples include BioBERT for biomedical text, SciBERT for scientific papers, and FinBERT for financial documents. These models demonstrate superior performance in their respective domains compared to the general-purpose BERT.

Multilingual BERT (mBERT) was trained on Wikipedia data from 104 languages, using a shared vocabulary across all languages. Despite not having explicit cross-lingual objectives during training, mBERT shows remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual transfer abilities, allowing it to perform tasks in languages it wasn't explicitly aligned on. This has made it a valuable resource for low-resource languages and cross-lingual applications.

## Training

### BERT

The fundamental difference in their architectures naturally leads to distinct training objectives. BERT, with its encoder-only design, is trained using two primary unsupervised tasks: Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/master/docs/img/MLM.png){width=70% fig-align="center"}

In MLM, a percentage of input tokens are randomly masked, and the model is tasked with predicting the original masked tokens based on the full, bidirectional context of the sentence. For example, given the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog," BERT might see "The quick brown [MASK] jumps over the lazy dog" and predict "fox."

NSP involves presenting the model with two sentences and asking it to predict whether the second sentence logically follows the first. For instance, given Sentence A: "The cat sat on the mat." and Sentence B: "It was a sunny day.", BERT would predict 'IsNextSentence = No', whereas for Sentence A: "The cat sat on the mat." and Sentence B: "It was purring softly.", BERT would predict 'IsNextSentence = Yes'. These tasks enable BERT to learn deep contextual representations useful for understanding existing text.

### Recipe for MLM

To generate training data for MLM, BERT randomly masks 15% of the tokens in each sequence. However, the masking process is not as straightforward as simply replacing words with [MASK] tokens. For the 15% of tokens chosen for masking, 80% of the time the word is replaced with the [MASK] token (example: "the cat sat on the mat" becomes "the cat [MASK] on the mat"). 10% of the time the word is replaced with a random word (example: "the cat sat on the mat" becomes "the cat dog on the mat"). 10% of the time the word is kept unchanged (example: "the cat sat on the mat" stays "the cat sat on the mat").

The model must predict the original token for all selected positions, regardless of whether they were masked, replaced, or left unchanged. This helps prevent the model from simply learning to detect replaced tokens. During training, the model processes the modified input sequence through its transformer layers and predicts the original token at each masked position using the contextual representations. While replacing words with random tokens or leaving them unchanged may seem counterintuitive, research has shown this approach is effective. It has become an essential component of BERT's pre-training process.

### Recipe for NSP

Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) trains BERT to understand relationships between sentences. The model learns to predict whether two sentences naturally follow each other in text. During training, half of the sentence pairs are consecutive sentences from documents (labeled as IsNext), while the other half are random sentence pairs (labeled as NotNext).

The input format uses special tokens to structure the sentence pairs: a [CLS] token at the start, the first sentence, a [SEP] token, the second sentence, and a final [SEP] token. For instance:

$$
\text{``[CLS] }\underbrace{\text{I went to the store}}_{\text{Sentence 1}}\text{ [SEP] }\underbrace{\text{They were out of milk}}_{\text{Sentence 2}}\text{ [SEP]''}.
$$

BERT uses the final hidden state of the [CLS] token to classify whether the sentences are consecutive or not. This helps the model develop a broader understanding of language context and relationships between sentences.

### GPT

GPT, on the other hand, uses its decoder-only architecture for Causal Language Modeling (CLM). Causal (autoregressive) language modeling is the pre-training objective of GPT, where the model learns to predict the next token given all previous tokens in the sequence. More formally, given a sequence of tokens $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$, the model is trained to maximize the likelihood:

$$
P(x_1, ..., x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(x_i|x_1, ..., x_{i-1})
$$

For example, given the partial sentence "The cat sat on", the model learns to predict the next word by calculating probability distributions over its entire vocabulary. During training, it might learn that "mat" has a high probability in this context, while "laptop" has a lower probability.

This autoregressive nature means GPT always processes text from left to right, learning to generate coherent and grammatically correct continuations. This objective directly aligns with its strength in text generation.

## Visualizing Attention: What Is BERT Looking At?

BERT produces attention weights—a matrix showing which tokens influence each other. We can extract these weights and visualize them to understand how the model disambiguates meaning.

```{python}
import torch
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load a small BERT model
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name, output_attentions=True)

text = "The bank of the river."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)

# Get attention from the last layer
# Shape: (batch, heads, seq_len, seq_len)
attention = outputs.attentions[-1].squeeze(0)

# Average attention across all heads for simplicity
mean_attention = attention.mean(dim=0).detach().numpy()
tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(inputs["input_ids"][0])

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(mean_attention, xticklabels=tokens, yticklabels=tokens, cmap="viridis")
plt.title("BERT Attention Map (Last Layer)")
plt.xlabel("Key (Source)")
plt.ylabel("Query (Target)")
plt.show()
```

In this heatmap, a bright spot at row "bank" and column "river" reveals that BERT is using "river" to understand "bank", disambiguating it from a financial institution. This bidirectional flow is why BERT excels at tasks requiring deep contextual understanding like question answering and named entity recognition.

## The Takeaway

BERT reads to understand. GPT writes to create. Choose the architecture that matches your information flow: bidirectional for deep contextual analysis, causal for sequential generation.
