        "Imagine trying to explain the meaning of words to someone who only understands numbers. This is exactly the challenge we face when teaching computers to process text. Just as we need to translate between languages, we need to translate between the world of human language and the world of computer numbers. This translation process has evolved dramatically over time, becoming increasingly sophisticated in its ability to capture the nuances of meaning.\n",

        "\n",
        "The simplest approach to this translation challenge is one-hot encoding, akin to giving each word its own unique light switch in a vast room of switches. When representing a word, we turn on its switch and leave all others off. For example, in a tiny vocabulary of just three words {cat, dog, fish}:\n",

        "However, TF-IDF has its limitations. It only captures word-document relationships, missing out on the rich word-word relationships that occur within documents. This limitation led researchers to develop more sophisticated techniques like word2vec, which we'll explore in the next section.\n",
