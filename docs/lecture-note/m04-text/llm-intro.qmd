## Spoiler
Large language models don't understand language—they compress statistical regularities from billions of text samples into probability distributions that generate fluent outputs correlated with truth but not guaranteed to be true.

## The Naive Model vs. The Reality

If a machine writes coherent essays, debugs code, and answers questions accurately, it must understand language the way humans do. This intuition traces to Turing's 1950 test: if you can't tell it's a machine, treat it as intelligent. The assumption is that fluency requires comprehension.

ELIZA, a 1960s chatbot, shattered this assumption. It convinced users it was a therapist using only keyword substitution and reflection—no comprehension, just pattern matching. Large language models are ELIZA scaled by thirteen orders of magnitude. They predict which word comes next in a sequence, nothing more. Yet this simple objective forces them to encode grammar, facts, logic, and context—not because they understand, but because **prediction requires compression of statistical regularities.** The model that best predicts "The capital of France is ___" must have compressed the statistical pattern linking countries to capitals, whether or not it "knows" what a capital is.

The paradox: optimizing for prediction creates representations that look like understanding. But probe the extremes—ask about events after the training cutoff, request precise citations, demand genuine reasoning—and the illusion breaks. The model follows fluency where truth data is sparse.

## The Hidden Mechanism

Imagine you want to predict lottery numbers but can't compute true probabilities. You memorize millions of historical draws. When asked "What comes next?", you recall similar past sequences and output the most common continuation. You're not computing probabilities; you're pattern matching against compressed memory. This is the toy model for how LLMs work.

LLMs function like lossy compression algorithms. To predict "The capital of France is ___," the model must compress not just the fact (Paris) but the **statistical regularities** governing how facts appear in text—that capitals follow "The capital of," that France is a country, that countries have capitals. This compression is probabilistic, not factual. The model stores $P(\text{word}_{n+1} \mid \text{word}_1, \ldots, \text{word}_n)$, which words tend to follow which other words in which contexts.

![](../figs/llm-next-word.gif){width=50% fig-alt="A GIF showing how LLMs predict the next word by estimating probability distributions over the vocabulary." fig-align="center"}

Training feeds the model billions of sentences. For each sentence, the model predicts the next word, compares its prediction to the actual next word, and adjusts its parameters to increase the probability of the correct word. Repeat trillions of times. The result: a compressed representation of how language behaves statistically. The model doesn't learn "Paris is the capital of France" as a fact; it learns that in contexts matching the pattern `[The capital of France is]`, the token "Paris" appears with high probability.

This optimization creates **hallucination**, fluent but false outputs. The model optimizes for probability, not truth. If it has seen 1,000 sentences about quantum networks and 10 about quantum community detection, it fabricates plausible results for a non-existent "Smith et al. paper" because that pattern fits academic writing. Truth and fluency correlate in the training data, so the model is mostly truthful. But in the tails—obscure topics, recent events, precise recall—fluency diverges from truth, and the model follows fluency.

Two constraints compound this issue. First, **context limits**: models see only 2,000–8,000 tokens at once, meaning that if you paste 100 abstracts, early ones are mathematically evicted from the model's working memory. Second, **stochasticity**: the model samples from probability distributions, so the same prompt yields different outputs across runs. Fluency is deterministic; specifics are random.

## The Strategic Application

Use LLMs to scale pattern recognition, not judgment. They excel where speed trumps precision: summarizing 50 abstracts to identify the 10 worth reading, extracting structured data from unstructured text, reformulating technical concepts, brainstorming research directions. They fail where precision is paramount—verifying citations, making ethical decisions, performing statistical analysis. Think of an LLM as an assistant who has read the internet but remembers imperfectly. You delegate skimming. You verify everything.

The events that matter live in the tail. Most outputs are fluent and useful. But the hallucinated citation that undermines credibility, the missed context that skews analysis—these failures cluster in the tails of the probability distribution. Harvest the center. Defend against the extremes.

## Setting Up Ollama

For this course, we use Ollama, a tool for running LLMs locally, with Gemma 3N, a 4-billion parameter open-source model. Free, private, capable enough for research tasks. Visit [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai), download the installer, and verify installation:

```bash
ollama --version
ollama pull gemma3n:latest
ollama run gemma3n:latest "What is a complex system?"
```

If you receive a coherent response, install the Python client and send your first prompt:

```bash
pip install ollama
```

```{python}
import ollama

params_llm = {"model": "gemma3n:latest", "options": {"temperature": 0.3}}

response = ollama.generate(
    prompt="Explain emergence in two sentences.",
    **params_llm
)

print(response.response)
```

Running this twice produces different outputs because LLMs sample from probability distributions. The **temperature** parameter controls this randomness—lower values (0.1) make outputs more deterministic; higher values (1.0) increase diversity. You're controlling how far into the tail of the probability distribution the model samples.

## Research Applications

The strategy is simple: use LLMs for tasks where speed trumps precision, then verify the outputs that matter. Three workflows demonstrate this pattern.

First, abstract summarization. You collected 50 papers on network science. Which deserve detailed reading? LLMs scan them in seconds:

```{python}
abstract = """
Community detection in networks is a fundamental problem in complex systems.
While many algorithms exist, most assume static networks. We propose a dynamic
community detection algorithm that tracks evolving communities over time using
a temporal smoothness constraint. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real
temporal networks, showing it outperforms static methods applied to temporal
snapshots. Our approach reveals how communities merge, split, and persist in
social networks, biological systems, and transportation networks.
"""

prompt = f"Summarize this abstract in one sentence:\n\n{abstract}"
response = ollama.generate(prompt=prompt, **params_llm)
print(response.response)
```

The model captures the pattern: propose method, evaluate, outperform baselines. It doesn't understand the paper; it has seen enough academic abstracts to recognize the structure. For multiple abstracts, loop through them:

```{python}
for i, abstract in enumerate(["Abstract 1...", "Abstract 2..."], 1):
    response = ollama.generate(prompt=f"Summarize:\n\n{abstract}", **params_llm)
    print(f"{i}. {response.response}")
```

Local models are slow (2–5 seconds per abstract). For thousands of papers, switch to cloud APIs. But the workflow scales: delegate skimming to the model, retain judgment for yourself.

Second, structured extraction. Turn unstructured text into structured data automatically:

```{python}
abstract = """
We analyze scientific collaboration networks using 5 million papers from
2000-2020. Using graph neural networks and community detection, we identify
disciplinary boundaries and interdisciplinary bridges. Interdisciplinarity
increased 25%, with physics and CS showing strongest cross-connections.
"""

prompt = f"""Extract: Domain, Methods, Key Finding\n\n{abstract}\n\nFormat:\nDomain:...\nMethods:...\nKey Finding:..."""
response = ollama.generate(prompt=prompt, **params_llm)
print(response.response)
```

Scale this to hundreds of papers for meta-analysis. Always verify—LLMs misinterpret obscure terminology and fabricate plausible-sounding technical details when uncertain.

Third, hypothesis generation. LLMs pattern-match against research questions they've encountered in training data:

```{python}
context = """I study concept spread in citation networks. Highly cited papers
combine existing concepts novelty. What should I study next?"""

prompt = f"""Suggest three follow-up research questions:\n\n{context}"""
response = ollama.generate(prompt=prompt, **params_llm)
print(response.response)
```

Treat the model as a thought partner, not an oracle. It helps structure thinking but doesn't possess domain expertise. The suggestions reflect patterns in how research questions are framed, not deep knowledge of your field.

## Failure Modes and Boundaries

The failure modes follow directly from the mechanism. LLMs fabricate plausibly because they optimize for fluency, not truth. Ask about a non-existent "Smith et al. quantum paper" and receive fluent academic prose describing results that never happened. Always verify citations. The model has seen thousands of papers cited in the format "Smith et al. (2023) demonstrated that..." and generates outputs matching that pattern even when the citation is fictional.

Context limits are architectural. Models see only 2,000–8,000 tokens at once. Paste 100 abstracts and early ones are mathematically evicted from working memory. The model doesn't "remember" them; they're gone. Knowledge cutoffs are temporal. Gemma 3N's training ended early 2024. Ask about recent events and receive outdated information or plausible fabrications constructed from pre-cutoff patterns.

Reasoning is absent. LLMs pattern-match, they don't reason. Ask "How many r's in 'Strawberry'?" and the model might answer correctly via pattern matching against similar questions in training data, not by counting letters. Sometimes right. Often wrong. The model has no internal representation of what counting means.

These aren't bugs to be fixed. They're intrinsic to the architecture. Use LLMs to accelerate work, not replace judgment. They excel at summarizing text, extracting structure, reformulating concepts, brainstorming, generating synthetic examples, and translation. They fail at literature reviews without verification, factual claims without sources, statistical analysis, and ethical decisions. Harvest the center of the distribution where fluency and truth correlate. Defend against the tails where they diverge.

## Next

You've seen LLMs in practice—setup, summarization, extraction, limitations. But how do they actually work? What happens inside when you send a prompt?

The rest of this module unboxes the technology: **prompt engineering** (communicating with LLMs), **embeddings** (representing meaning as numbers), **transformers** (the architecture enabling modern NLP), **fundamentals** (from word counts to neural representations).

First, let's master talking to machines.
