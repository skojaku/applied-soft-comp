        "One may argue that \"fluency\" demonstrates understanding. This is the intuition behind Turing's 1950 test: if you can't tell it's a machine, treat it as intelligent. Fluency implies comprehension.\n",
        "\n",
        "But let's see some counter arguments about this claim, starting with ELIZA.\n",
        "\n",
        "ELIZA, developed by Joseph Weizenbaum in the mid-1960s, is widely considered one of the first chatbots. It simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist by using simple pattern matching and keyword substitution to generate responses. Despite its lack of true understanding, ELIZA famously convinced many users that they were conversing with an intelligent entity, highlighting the human tendency to anthropomorphize technology and the limitations of the Turing Test.\n",

        "\n",
        "Another argument against fluency is the Chinese Room argument, proposed by philosopher John Searle. Imagine a person in a room who receives Chinese characters, and using an English rulebook, manipulates these symbols to produce new Chinese characters. To an outside observer, it appears the room understands Chinese. However, the person inside merely follows instructions to manipulate symbols without understanding their meaning. Searle argues that this is analogous to how computers, including LLMs, operate: they process symbols based on rules without genuine comprehension, raising questions about whether they can truly \"understand\" language or the world.\n",

        "So, do LLMs understand the world? Probably not, in the same way as we do. LLMs is a lossy compression algorithm, compressing the data into their parameters to generate fluent outputs. To predict \"The capital of France is ___,\" the model must compress not just the fact (Paris) but the **statistical regularities** governing how facts appear in text---that capitals follow \"The capital of,\" that France is a country, that countries have capitals. This compression is probabilistic, not factual. The model stores $P(\\text{word}_{n+1} \\mid \\text{word}_1, \\ldots, \\text{word}_n)$---which words tend to follow which other words in which contexts. Just as the lottery memorizer stores patterns of number sequences, the LLM stores patterns of word sequences.\n",

        "\n",
        "Training feeds the model billions of sentences. For each sentence, the model predicts the next word, compares its prediction to the actual next word, and adjusts its parameters to increase the probability of the correct word. Repeat trillions of times. The result: a compressed representation of how language behaves statistically. The model doesn't learn \"Paris is the capital of France\" as a fact; it learns that in contexts matching the pattern `[The capital of France is]`, the token \"Paris\" appears with high probability. The lottery memorizer doesn't understand what draws mean; it just knows what patterns appear most often. This is why LLMs creates **hallucination**---fluent but false outputs. Truth and fluency correlate in the training data, so the model is mostly truthful. But in the tails---obscure topics, recent events, precise recall---fluency diverges from truth, and the model follows fluency.\n",
