This module explores how word embeddings capture and reinforce societal biases.

You'll learn:

- How **semantic axes** reveal gender bias in occupations and concepts through geometric relationships.
- How to **measure bias** using cosine similarity and the SemAxis framework.
- The difference between **direct bias** (explicit gender associations) and **indirect bias** (gender encoded through proxy dimensions).
- Why understanding these biases matters for building fair AI systems.

## Understanding Bias in Word Embeddings

Have you ever wondered what biases might be hiding in word embeddings? Word embeddings capture and reinforce societal biases from their training data through geometric relationships between word vectors, often reflecting stereotypes about gender, race, age, and other social factors.

SemAxis is a powerful tool to analyze gender bias in word embeddings by measuring word alignments along semantic axes. Using antonym pairs like "she-he" as poles, it quantifies gender associations in words on a scale from -1 to 1, where positive values indicate feminine associations while negative values indicate masculine associations. Let's start with a simple example of analyzing gender bias in occupations.

```{python}
import gensim.downloader as api
import numpy as np

# Load pre-trained Word2vec embeddings
model = api.load("word2vec-google-news-300")
```

```{python}
def compute_bias(word, microframe, model):
    word_vector = model[word]
    numerator = np.dot(word_vector, microframe)
    denominator = np.linalg.norm(word_vector) * np.linalg.norm(microframe)
    return numerator / denominator


def analyze(word, pos_word, neg_word, model):
    if word not in model:
        return 0.0
    microframe = model[pos_word] - model[neg_word]
    bias = compute_bias(word, microframe, model)
    return bias
```

What's happening in compute_bias? The function calculates the cosine similarity between a word vector and a semantic axis (microframe), where the numerator computes the dot product (projecting the word onto the axis) and the denominator normalizes by vector lengths to get a score between -1 and 1. Let's use these occupations:

```{python}
# Occupations from the paper
she_occupations = [
    "homemaker",
    "nurse",
    "receptionist",
    "librarian",
    "socialite",
    "hairdresser",
    "nanny",
    "bookkeeper",
    "stylist",
    "housekeeper",
]

he_occupations = [
    "maestro",
    "skipper",
    "protege",
    "philosopher",
    "captain",
    "architect",
    "financier",
    "warrior",
    "broadcaster",
    "magician",
    "boss",
]
```

We measure the gender bias in these occupations by measuring how they align with the "she-he" axis.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
print("Gender Bias in Occupations (she-he axis):")
print("\nShe-associated occupations:")
for occupation in she_occupations:
    bias = analyze(occupation, "she", "he", model)
    print(f"{occupation}: {bias:.3f}")

print("\nHe-associated occupations:")
for occupation in he_occupations:
    bias = analyze(occupation, "she", "he", model)
    print(f"{occupation}: {bias:.3f}")
```

How do we interpret these scores? Positive scores indicate closer association to "she" (e.g., nurse, librarian), while negative scores indicate closer association to "he" (e.g., architect, captain), with magnitude showing the strength of association. Notice how occupations historically associated with women have strong positive scores while those associated with men have negative scores, confirming that the model has learned these gender stereotypes from the text data.

## Stereotype Analogies

What happens when we look at word pairs? Since word embeddings capture semantic relationships from large text corpora, they inevitably encode societal biases and stereotypes. Let's measure how different words align with the gender axis (she-he) to find pairs where one word shows strong feminine bias while its counterpart shows masculine bias, revealing ingrained stereotypes in language use.

```{python}
# Stereotype analogies from the paper
stereotype_pairs = [
    ("sewing", "carpentry"),
    ("nurse", "surgeon"),
    ("softball", "baseball"),
    ("cosmetics", "pharmaceuticals"),
    ("vocalist", "guitarist"),
]
```

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
print("\nAnalyzing Gender Stereotype Pairs:")
for word1, word2 in stereotype_pairs:
    bias1 = analyze(word1, "she", "he", model)
    bias2 = analyze(word2, "she", "he", model)
    print(f"\n{word1} vs {word2}")
    print(f"{word1}: {bias1:.3f}")
    print(f"{word2}: {bias2:.3f}")
```

The results show clear stereotypical alignments where sewing and nurse align with "she" while carpentry and surgeon align with "he", mirroring the "man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker" analogy found in early word embedding research.

## Indirect Bias: When Neutral Words Become Gendered

What about words that don't explicitly reference gender? Indirect bias occurs when seemingly neutral words become associated with gender through their relationships with other words. For example, while "softball" and "football" are not inherently gendered terms, they may show gender associations due to how they're used in language and society.

We can detect indirect bias by identifying word pairs that form a semantic axis (like softball-football), measuring how other words align with this axis, and examining if alignment correlates with gender bias. Let's see how this works by measuring the gender bias of these words:

```{python}
# Words associated with softball-football axis
softball_associations = [
    "pitcher",
    "bookkeeper",
    "receptionist",
    "nurse",
    "waitress"
]

football_associations = [
    "footballer",
    "businessman",
    "pundit",
    "maestro",
    "cleric"
]

# Calculate biases for all words
gender_biases = []
sports_biases = []
words = softball_associations + football_associations

for word in words:
    gender_bias = analyze(word, "she", "he", model)
    sports_bias = analyze(word, "softball", "football", model)
    gender_biases.append(gender_bias)
    sports_biases.append(sports_bias)
```

Let's plot the results:

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
# Analyze bias along both gender and sports axes
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from adjustText import adjust_text

# Create scatter plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x=gender_biases, y=sports_biases, ax=ax)
ax.set_xlabel("Gender Bias (she-he)")
ax.set_ylabel("Sports Bias (softball-football)")
ax.set_title("Indirect Bias Analysis: Gender vs Sports")

# Add labels for each point
texts = []
for i, word in enumerate(words):
    texts.append(ax.text(gender_biases[i], sports_biases[i], word, fontsize=12))

adjust_text(texts, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-', color='gray', lw=0.5))

ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()
sns.despine()
```

The plot reveals a correlation where words associated with "softball" (y-axis greater than 0) also tend to be associated with "she" (x-axis greater than 0), while "football" terms align with "he". This suggests that even if we remove explicit gender words, the structure of the space still encodes gender through these proxy dimensions.

## The Impact and Path Forward

Word embeddings, while powerful, inevitably capture and reflect societal biases present in the large text corpora they are trained on. We observed both direct bias (where occupations or attributes align strongly with specific gender pronouns) and indirect bias (where seemingly neutral concepts become gendered through their associations with other words). This analysis highlights the importance of understanding and mitigating these biases to prevent the perpetuation of stereotypes in AI systems and ensure fairness in applications like search, recommendation, and hiring.
