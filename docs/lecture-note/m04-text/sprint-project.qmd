::: {.callout-note title="Your mission"}
You have 60 minutes to create a custom Semaxis, project texts onto it, and find the weirdest outliers. Then present your most surprising discoveries to the class for voting.
:::

## The Challenge

You receive unlabeled text data (tweets, headlines, etc.). Define a custom semantic axis (e.g., "Technical vs. Emotional" or "Formal vs. Casual") using anchor terms. Generate embeddings and project all texts onto your axis. Hunt for texts that land in unexpected positions. Which tweet seems "Happy" but scores as "Sad"? Which technical term lands on the "Simple" end?

## The Rules

**Time:** 60 minutes of work, followed by presentations.

**Custom Semaxis Required:** Define at least one semantic axis with carefully chosen anchor terms.

**Embedding Model:** Use any sentence embedding model (Sentence-BERT, OpenAI, etc.). Document your choice.

**Outlier Discovery:** Identify at least three texts occupying surprising positions. Prepare explanations.

## Evaluation

The class votes on the most compelling discovery:

**Surprise Factor:** Genuinely unexpected findings that make people laugh or say "wait, what?"

**Insightfulness:** Discoveries that reveal something interesting about language or embedding models.

**Presentation:** Clear explanations with effective visualizations.

## Submission

Submit the link to your GitHub repository or notebook containing your Semaxis analysis and outlier discoveries to Brightspace.
