    "# Teaching computers how to understand words\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine trying to explain the meaning of words to someone who only understands numbers. This is exactly the challenge we face when teaching computers to process text. Just as we need to translate between languages, we need to translate between the world of human language and the world of computer numbers. This translation process has evolved dramatically over time, becoming increasingly sophisticated in its ability to capture the nuances of meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## One-Hot Encoding: The First Step\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest approach to this translation challenge is one-hot encoding, akin to giving each word its own unique light switch in a vast room of switches. When representing a word, we turn on its switch and leave all others off. For example, in a tiny vocabulary of just three words {cat, dog, fish}:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'cat' becomes [1, 0, 0]\n",
    "- 'dog' becomes [0, 1, 0]\n",
    "- 'fish' becomes [0, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While simple, this approach has a fundamental flaw: it suggests that all words are equally different from each other. In this representation, 'cat' is just as different from 'dog' as it is from 'algorithm' - something we know isn't true in real language use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distributional Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "What is missing in one-hot encoding is the notion of *context*.\n",
    "One associates `cat` with `dog` because they have similar context, while `cat` is more different from `fish` than `dog` because they are in different contexts.\n",
    "This is the core idea of the **distributional hypothesis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, the distributional hypothesis states that:\n",
    "- Words that frequently appear together in text (co-occur) are likely to be semantically related\n",
    "- The meaning of a word can be inferred by examining the distribution of other words around it\n",
    "- Similar words will have similar distributions of surrounding context words\n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis forms the theoretical foundation for many modern word embedding techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The idea that words can be understood by their context is captured by the famous linguistic principle: \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\" {footcite}`firth1957synopsis`. This principle suggests that the meaning of a word is not inherent to the word itself, but rather emerges from how it is used alongside other words.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "The ancient Buddhist concept of Apoha, developed by DignƒÅga in the 5th-6th century CE, shares similarities with modern distributional semantics. According to Apoha theory, we understand concepts by distinguishing what they are not - for example, we know what a \"cow\" is by recognizing everything that is not a cow. This mirrors how modern word embeddings define words through their relationships and contrasts with other words, showing how both ancient philosophy and contemporary linguistics recognize that meaning emerges from relationships between concepts.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, the distributional hypothesis states that we can understand the meaning of a word by examining the context in which it appears. Just as you might understand a person by the company they keep, we can understand a word by the words that surround it. This principle suggests that words appearing in similar contexts likely have similar meanings.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The distributional hypothesis leads us to an important question: How can we capture these contextual patterns mathematically?\n",
    "More specifically, what is a good unit of \"context\"?\n",
    "A natural choice is to let the *document* be the unit of context.\n",

    "- Each column represents a document\n",

    "We've discovered two problems with raw word counts:\n",
    "1. Common words like \"the\" and \"in\" dominate the counts, but they tell us little about document content\n",
    "2. Raw frequencies don't tell us how unique or informative a word is across documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it: if a word appears frequently in one document but rarely in others (like \"cheese\" in our example), it's probably more informative about that document's content than a word that appears equally frequently in all documents (like \"the\").\n",

    "This realization leads us to two important questions:\n",

    "Unlike one-hot encoding where each word is represented by a single position, TF-IDF represents each word through its pattern of occurrence across all documents. This distributed nature allows TF-IDF to capture semantic relationships: words that appear in similar documents will have similar patterns of TF-IDF scores.\n",

This clustering creates redundancy in the term-document matrix, as many terms are specific to certain clusters and rare in others.

This low-rank nature is useful for applications like dimensionality reduction and topic modeling, as it simplifies data visualization and analysis.\n",
