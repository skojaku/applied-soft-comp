    "# GloVe and FastText: Building on Word2Vec's Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "word2vec inspires a lot of follow-up work. Here we will introduce two notable ones: **GloVe** and **FastText**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## GloVe: Looking at the Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "GloVe approaches word embeddings from a fundamentally different perspective than Word2Vec. While Word2Vec learns incrementally by scanning through text with small context windows, predicting words from their neighbors, GloVe takes a more global approach by analyzing the entire corpus's word co-occurrence patterns at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences from Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "While Word2Vec learns incrementally by predicting context words through a neural network architecture, GloVe takes a more direct approach through matrix factorization. It explicitly models relationships between all word pairs at once, allowing it to capture global patterns that Word2Vec's local window approach might miss. GloVe's mathematical foundation as a matrix factorization model, similar to LSA but with improved weighting, makes its training objective more interpretable and connects it naturally to classical statistical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight behind GloVe is that the ratio of co-occurrence probabilities carries meaningful information. Let's look at a concrete example:"

    "## FastText: Understanding Parts of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "FastText took a different approach to improving word embeddings. Its key insight was that words themselves have internal structure that carries meaning. Consider how you understand a word you've never seen before, like \"unhelpfulness.\" Even if you've never encountered this exact word, you can understand it by recognizing its parts: \"un-\" (meaning not), \"help\" (the root word), and \"-fulness\" (meaning the quality of).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Subword Generation**: Break words into character n-grams\n",
    "   - Example: \"where\" â†’ \"<wh\", \"whe\", \"her\", \"ere\", \"re>\"\n",
    "   - The < and > marks show word boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vector Creation**:\n",
    "   - Each subword gets its own vector\n",
    "   - A word's final vector is the sum of its subword vectors\n",
    "   - This allows handling of new words!\n",
