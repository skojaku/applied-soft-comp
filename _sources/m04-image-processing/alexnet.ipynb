    "# AlexNet: A Breakthrough in Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we train a computer to recognize 1000 different types of objects across more than a million images, and what makes this problem so challenging?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual Foundation: The ImageNet Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into AlexNet, let's explore **why** large-scale image classification posed such a formidable problem for machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Massive Dataset**: The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) dataset contains over 1.2 million training images labeled across 1000 categories.\n",
    "2. **Computational Demands**: Traditional approaches struggled both with the sheer volume of data and with the complexity of designing handcrafted features.\n",
    "3. **Error Plateaus**: Prior to 2012, the best error rates hovered around 25%, suggesting that existing methods had nearly peaked using conventional feature-engineering techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs11263-015-0816-y/MediaObjects/11263_2015_816_Fig2_HTML.gif\n",

    "\n",
    "The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "Prior to AlexNet, most computer vision systems relied on hand-engineered features such as SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) or HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients). These were labor-intensive to design and often failed to generalize well to diverse images.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2012, a team led by **Alex Krizhevsky**, **Ilya Sutskever**, and **Geoffrey Hinton** demonstrated a deep **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** that shattered expectations. Their submission, known as **AlexNet**, reduced the top-5 error rate to **16.4%**—a remarkable improvement of **over 10 percentage points** compared to the next-best approach {footcite}`krizhevsky2012alexnet`.\n",

    "Top 5 error rates of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) from 2010 to 2017. AlexNet reduced the error rate by over 10 percentage points compared to the best performing method based on human-crafted features in 2011.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This breakthrough ignited the **deep learning revolution** in computer vision. Researchers quickly realized the potential of stacking many layers of neural networks—provided they could overcome critical hurdles in training and regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Innovations in AlexNet\n",
    "\n",
    "### ReLU Activation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge**:\n",
    "Deep neural networks often suffer from the **vanishing gradient problem**, making early layers in the network extremely hard to train. Common activation functions like the sigmoid:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "suffer from saturation, where the gradient becomes almost zero if the input $x$ is large (positive or negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The AlexNet Solution**:\n",
    "Introduce the **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)** {footcite}`nair2010rectified`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{ReLU}(x) = \\max(0, x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:474/1*HGctgaVdv9rEHIVvLYONdQ.jpeg\n",
    ":width: 100%\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid vs. ReLU activation functions. Sigmoid can cause gradients to vanish for $x$ far from zero, whereas ReLU maintains a constant gradient (1) for $x>0$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benefits**:\n",
    "  - Avoids vanishing gradients for positive $x$.\n",
    "  - **Computationally efficient**: Only a simple check if $x>0$.\n",
    "- **Drawback**:\n",
    "  - Neurons can \"die\" (always output zero) if $x$ stays negative. Variants like **Leaky ReLU** or **Parametric ReLU (PReLU)** introduce a small slope for $x \\leq 0$ to mitigate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Leaky ReLU/PReLU are typically defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "x & \\text{if } x > 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\alpha x & \\text{if } x \\leq 0\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is a small positive constant.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropout Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep networks with millions of parameters can easily **overfit** to the training data, harming their ability to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AlexNet solution is to use **Dropout** {footcite}`srivastava2014dropout`, a technique that randomly disables (or \"drops out\") neurons with probability $p$ during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/av-blog-media/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1IrdJ5PghD9YoOyVAQ73MJw.gif\n",
    ":width: 100%\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout in action.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training**: Each neuron is \"dropped\" with probability $p$, forcing the network to not rely on any single neuron’s output.\n",
    "2. **Inference**: All neurons are used, but their outputs are scaled by $(1-p)$ to maintain expected values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "An alternative known as *inverse dropout* scales weights by $1/(1-p)$ during training, removing the need for scaling during inference. This is how many popular deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow) implement dropout.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Local Response Normalization (LRN)\n",
    "\n",
    "In CNNs, neighboring feature maps can become disproportionately large, leading to unstable or less discriminative representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the AlexNet, this is rectified by **Local Response Normalization (LRN)** {footcite}`alexnet-lrn`, which normalizes activity across adjacent channels:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "b^i_{x,y} = \\frac{a^i_{x,y}}{\\Bigl(k + \\alpha \\sum_{j=\\max(0,i-\\frac{n}{2})}^{\\min(N-1,i+\\frac{n}{2})} (a^j_{x,y})^2\\Bigr)^\\beta}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, \\(a^i_{x,y}\\) is the activation at channel \\(i\\), and \\(k, \\alpha, \\beta, n\\) are constants. LRN encourages local competition among adjacent channels, akin to certain neural mechanisms in biological systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "LRN is less commonly used in modern architectures (like VGG, ResNet, etc.) which often rely on batch normalization or other normalization techniques. Still, LRN was a key component in AlexNet’s success at the time.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The AlexNet Architecture\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Layer-by-Layer Overview**:\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Conv1**: [11×11, stride=4, padding=2] → ReLU → LRN → Overlapping Max Pool ([3×3], stride=2)\n",
    "3. **Conv2**: [5×5, stride=1, padding=2] → ReLU → LRN → Overlapping Max Pool ([3×3], stride=2)\n",
    "4. **Conv3**: [3×3, stride=1, padding=1] → ReLU\n",

    "6. **Conv5**: [3×3, stride=1, padding=1] → ReLU → Overlapping Max Pool ([3×3], stride=2)\n",
    "7. **FC6**: Flatten → 9216 → 4096 → ReLU → Dropout\n",
    "8. **FC7**: 4096 → 4096 → ReLU → Dropout\n",
    "9. **FC8**: 4096 → 1000 → Softmax Output\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "**Parallel GPU Computation**\n",
    "AlexNet was trained on two GPUs with 3GB of memory each, splitting feature maps between them to handle the large parameter count. This approach showcased the necessity and practicality of GPU computing for large-scale deep learning.\n",
