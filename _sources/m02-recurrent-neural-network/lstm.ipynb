    "# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While the RNN model is able to handle the sequence data, it struggles with the long-term dependencies. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model {footcite}`hochreiter1997long` is designed to overcome this limitation by introducing a \"controlled\" memory cell that can maintain information over long periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LSTM Architecture\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "LSTM architecture showing the cell state (horizontal line at top) and the three gates: forget gate, input gate, and output gate. The cell state acts as a conveyor belt carrying information forward, while gates control information flow.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The input and output of LSTM is fundamentally the same as the simple RNN we have seen before. The only difference is that LSTM has two kinds of hidden states: the hidden state $h_t$ and the cell state (or memory cell) $c_t$.\n",
    "The hidden state $h_t$ is the output of the LSTM, and it is used to predict the next state. The cell state $c_t$ is the internal state of the LSTM, and it is used to maintain the memory of the LSTM.\n",
    "Think of this cell as a conveyor belt that runs straight through the network, allowing information to flow forward largely unchanged. This cell state forms the backbone of the LSTM's memory system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Dive into LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, LSTM controls the flow of information through the cell state by using three gates: the forget gate, the input gate, and the output gate. Let us break down each gate and see how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forget Gate\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../figs/lstm-forget-gate.jpg\n",

    "Forget gate. $\\sigma(x_t, h_t)$ decides how much of the previous cell state $c_{t-1}$ to keep. For example, if $\\sigma(x_t, h_t) = 0$, the forget gate will completely forget the previous cell state. If $\\sigma(x_t, h_t) = 1$, the forget gate will keep the previous cell state. $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function which is bounded between 0 and 1.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The *forget gate* examines the current input and the previous hidden state to decide what information to remove from the cell state. Like a selective eraser, it outputs values between 0 and 1 for each number in the cell state, where 0 means \"completely forget this\" and 1 means \"keep this entirely.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input Gate\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../figs/lstm-input-gate.jpg\n",

    "Input gate. $\\sigma(x_t, h_t)$ decides how much of the new information (that passes through the tanh function) to add to the cell state. For example, if $\\sigma(x_t, h_t) = 0$, the input gate will completely ignore the new candidate information. If $\\sigma(x_t, h_t) = 1$, the input gate will add the new candidate information to the cell state.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The input gate works together with a candidate memory generator to decide what new information to store. The input gate determines how much of the new candidate values should be added to the cell state, while the candidate memory proposes new values that could be added. This mechanism allows the network to selectively update its memory with new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output Gate\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../figs/lstm-output-gate.jpg\n",

    "Output gate. $\\sigma(x_t, h_t)$ decides how much of the cell state to reveal as output. For example, if $\\sigma(x_t, h_t) = 0$, the output gate will completely hide the cell state. If $\\sigma(x_t, h_t) = 1$, the output gate will reveal the cell state.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output gate controls what parts of the cell state should be revealed as output. It applies a filtered version of the cell state to produce the hidden state, which serves as both the output for the current timestep and part of the input for the next timestep.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The key innovation of LSTMs is not just having memory, but having controlled memory. The network learns what to remember and what to forget, rather than trying to remember everything.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The LSTM's operation can be described through a series of equations that work together to process sequential data. The cell state $C_t$ evolves according to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C_t = f_t \\odot C_{t-1} + i_t \\odot \\tilde{C}_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f_t$ is the forget gate, $i_t$ is the input gate, and $\\tilde{C}_t$ is the candidate memory. The $\\odot$ symbol represents element-wise multiplication, allowing the gates to control information flow by scaling values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gates themselves are neural networks that take the current input $x_t$ and previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ as inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_t = \\sigma(W_f[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) $$\n",
    "$$ i_t = \\sigma(W_i[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) $$\n",
    "$$ o_t = \\sigma(W_o[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The candidate memory is generated similarly:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{C}_t = \\tanh(W_c[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_c) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the hidden state is produced by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h_t = o_t \\odot \\tanh(C_t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hands on\n",
    "\n",
    "We will train an LSTM model to identify a wrapped character in a sequence. The task is to predict which character is enclosed in `<>` tags within a sequence of randomly ordered uppercase letters. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST<U>VWXYZ`\n",
    "- Output: `U`\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires a selective memory that can remember the wrapped character and forget the rest of the characters, which is exactly what LSTM is designed for.\n",

    "We see that the validation loss increased as the training progressed. This implies overfitting, i.e. the model is too expressive and memorizes the training data but lacks the understanding of underlying patterns and thereby generalizes poorly to unseen data. This is a common problem in deep learning.\n",

    "Regularization is a technique to prevent a model from overfitting. A traditional way to regularize a model is to add a penalty term to the loss function, e.g., $L = L_{\\text{data}} + \\lambda L_{\\text{reg}}$, where $L_{\\text{data}}$ is the data loss and $L_{\\text{reg}}$ is the regularization loss.\n",
    "Another popular regularization technique is dropout {footcite}`srivastava2014dropout`, which randomly drops out some neurons during training to prevent the model from relying too heavily on specific features.\n",

    "Let's fix the model by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try increasing the number of hidden units in the LSTM model.\n",
    "2. Bring back to the original number of hidden units, and try increasing the number of layers in the LSTM model.\n",
    "3. Add dropout to the model by using `torch.nn.Dropout` on the output of the LSTM layer.\n",
    "4. Try increasing the learning rate.\n",
    "5. Play with other hyperparameters, e.g., the number of epochs, batch size, etc.\n",
    "5. Change the model to `nn.RNN` instead of `nn.LSTM`. You should replace `(h_n, c_n)` with `hidden` in the training and evaluation since `nn.RNN` does not have a cell state.\n",

    "You should be able to see the model to correctly predict the wrapped character.\n",
