    "# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Human language is sequential. A word is a sequence of letters, a sentence is a sequence of words, and a paragraph is a sequence of sentences. One key aspect of human language is that the meaning of a word depends on the context. For example, the word \"bank\" has different meanings in the sentences \"I went to the bank to deposit money.\" and \"I went to the bank to catch fish.\" Human can understand the contextual nuance because they can maintain a \"working memory\" that captures information from previous words.\n",
    "This is the core idea of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine reading a book while maintaining a \"summary\" in your mind that you update with each new sentence. This is similar to how RNNs work. Operationally, RNNs process a sequence of inputs $(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_T)$ one at a time, updating a *hidden state* $h_t$ that acts as a \"working memory\" that captures information from previous inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h_t = f(x_t, h_{t-1}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This captures the essence of RNNs: the current hidden state ($h_t$) depends on both the current input ($x_t$) and the previous hidden state ($h_{t-1}$).\n",
    "Function $f$ is a neural network that takes the current input and the previous hidden state as input and outputs the current hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Think of the hidden state as a \"working memory\" that's constantly being updated. Just as you might remember key plot points while reading a novel but forget minor details, the hidden state learns to maintain relevant information for the task at hand.\n",
    "```\n",

Left: Compact representation where NN processes input $x_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and hidden state $h_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ to produce output $o_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$. Right: Expanded view showing the concatenation $[x_t, h_{t-1}]$, linear transformations ($W, b_h$), and $\\tanh$ activation. Colors indicate corresponding components: inputs (blue), hidden states (green), outputs (pink), and transformations (yellow).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward pass of an RNN processes sequential data through a series of transformations as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The RNN first combines the current input vector $x_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and the previous hidden state $h_{t-1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ to form a new vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    v_t = [x_t, h_{t-1}]\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The concatenated vector is then transformed to the hidden state $h_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ via a linear transformation followed by the $\\tanh$ activation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    h_t = \\tanh(W_h v_t + b_h)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Meanwhile, the output is generated by transforming the hidden state $h_t$ using the output weight matrix $W_{o} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$:\n",

    "    $$\n",
    "    o_t = W_o v_t + b_o\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps produce an output vector $o_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ that represents the network's prediction or response at the current time step.

    ":name: forward-vs-backward-propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks can be trained using either forward or backward propagation, but backward propagation (backprop) is far more efficient.\n",
    "Consider a neural network with $n$ layers and $m$ parameters per layer.\n",
    "In forward propagation, for each parameter, we must propagate through all subsequent layers: first layer parameters need propagation through $n$ layers, second layer through $(n-1)$ layers, and last layer through $1$ layer. With $m$ operations per layer, this means $(m$ parameters $\\times$ $n$ layers $\\times$ $m$ ops) + $(m$ parameters $\\times$ $(n-1)$ layers $\\times$ $m$ ops) + ... + $(m$ parameters $\\times$ $1$ layer $\\times$ $m$ ops) = $O(m^2 n^2)$ operations total.\n",
    "In contrast, backpropagation makes just one forward and one backward pass to collect all derivatives, requiring only $O(mn)$ operations.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vanishing Gradient Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, think about what happens when these partial derivatives are consistently less than 1. For example, if each $\\frac{\\partial h_{i+1}}{\\partial h_i}$ is 0.5, and we're looking 10 timesteps back, the gradient becomes $(0.5)^{10} = 0.000977$ - practically zero! This is the vanishing gradient problem, making it extremely difficult for RNNs to learn from long-term dependencies.\n",
    "Conversely, if these derivatives are greater than 1, the gradients can explode, making training unstable. This is why architectures like LSTMs and GRUs were developed to better handle long-term dependencies, which we will cover in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient clipping prevents the vanishing and exploding gradient problem in RNNs by constraining how much the model parameters can change in a single update. Think of it as a \"speed limit\" - without clipping, parameter updates can become too large due to exploding gradients during backpropagation, causing the model to overshoot optimal values. By clipping gradients to a maximum norm (1.0 in this case), we keep updates within a reasonable range and maintain stable training.\n",
