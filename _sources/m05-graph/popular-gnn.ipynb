    "# Popular Graph Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this note, we will introduce three popular GNNs: GraphSAGE, Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN).\n",
    "\n",
    "## GraphSAGE: Sample and Aggregate\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphSAGE {footcite}`hamilton2017graphsage` introduced a different GCN that can be ***generalized to unseen nodes*** (they called it \"inductive\"). While previous approaches like ChebNet and GCN operate on the entire graph, GraphSAGE proposes an inductive framework that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://theaisummer.com/static/02e23adc75fe68e5dd249a94f3c1e8cc/c483d/graphsage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphSAGE involves two key ideas: (1) sampling and (2) aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neighborhood Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is the *neighborhood sampling*. Instead of using all neighbors, GraphSAGE samples a fixed-size set of neighbors for each node. This controls memory complexity, a key limitation of the previous GNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key advantage of neighborhood sampling is that it enables GraphSAGE to handle dynamic, growing networks. Consider a citation network where new papers (nodes) are continuously added. Traditional GCNs would need to recompute filters for the entire network with each new addition. In contrast, GraphSAGE can immediately generate embeddings for new nodes by simply sampling their neighbors, without any retraining or recomputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key idea is the *aggregation*. GraphSAGE makes a distinction between self-information and neighborhood information. While previous GNNs treat them equally and aggregate them, GraphSAGE treats them differently. Specifically, GraphSAGE introduces an additional step: it concatenates the self-information and the neighborhood information as the input of the convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z_v = \\text{CONCAT}(X_v, X_{\\mathcal{N}(v)})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X_v$ is the feature of the node itself and $X_{\\mathcal{N}(v)}$ is the aggregation of the features of its neighbors. GraphSAGE introduces different ways to aggregate information from neighbors:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$X_{\\mathcal{N}(v)} = \\text{AGGREGATE}_k(\\{X_u, \\forall u \\in \\mathcal{N}(v)\\})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Common aggregation functions include:\n",
    "   - Mean aggregator: $\\text{AGGREGATE} = \\text{mean}(\\{h_u, \\forall u \\in \\mathcal{N}(v)\\})$\n",
    "   - Max-pooling: $\\text{AGGREGATE} = \\max(\\{\\sigma(W_{\\text{pool}}h_u + b), \\forall u \\in \\mathcal{N}(v)\\})$\n",
    "   - LSTM aggregator: Apply LSTM to randomly permuted neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "The concatenated feature $Z_v$ is normalized by the L2 norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{Z}_v = \\frac{Z_v}{\\|Z_v\\|_2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and then fed into the convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_v^k = \\sigma(W^k \\hat{Z}_v + b^k)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Attention Networks (GAT): Differentiate Individual Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "A key innovation of GraphSAGE is to treat the self and neighborhood information differently. But should all neighbors be treated equally? Graph Attention Networks (GAT) address this by letting the model learn which neighbors to pay attention to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://production-media.paperswithcode.com/methods/Screen_Shot_2020-07-08_at_7.55.32_PM_vkdDcDx.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is beautifully simple: instead of using fixed weights like GCN, let's learn attention weights $\\alpha_{ij}$ that determine how much node $i$ should attend to node $j$. These weights are computed dynamically based on node features:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha_{ij} = \\frac{\\exp(e_{ij})}{\\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)} \\exp(e_{ik})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $e_{ij}$ represents the importance of the edge between node $i$ and node $j$. Variable $e_{ij}$ is a *learnable* parameter and can be negative, and the exponential function is applied to transform it to a non-negative value, with the normalization term $\\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)} \\exp(e_{ik})$ to ensure the weights sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to compute $e_{ij}$? One simple choice is to use a neural network with a shared weight matrix $W$ and a LeakyReLU activation function. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let's focus on computing $e_{ij}$ for node $i$ and its neighbor $j$.\n",
    "2. We use a shared weight matrix $W$ to transform the features of node $i$ and $j$.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathbf{\\tilde h}_i  = \\mathbf{h}_i, \\quad \\mathbf{\\tilde h}_j  = W\\mathbf{h}_j\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "3. We concatenate the transformed features and apply a LeakyReLU activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e_{ij} = \\text{LeakyReLU}(\\mathbf{a}^T[\\mathbf{\\tilde h}_i, \\mathbf{\\tilde h}_j])\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{a}$ is a trainable parameter vector that sums the two transformed features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have these attention weights, the node update is straightforward - just a weighted sum of neighbor features:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{h}'_i = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i) \\cup \\{i\\}} \\alpha_{ij}{\\bf W}_{\\text{feature}}\\mathbf{h}_j\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where ${\\bf W}_{\\text{feature}}$ is a trainable weight matrix. To stabilize training, GAT uses multiple attention heads and concatenates their outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{h}'_i = \\parallel_{k=1}^K \\sigma\\left(\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i) \\cup \\{i\\}} \\alpha_{ij}^k{\\bf W}^k_{\\text{feature}}\\mathbf{h}_j\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN): Differentiate the Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) is another popular GNN that born out of a question: what is the maximum discriminative power achievable by Graph Neural Networks? The answer lies in its theoretical connection to **the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test**, a powerful algorithm for graph isomorphism testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weisfeiler-Lehman Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Are two graphs structurally identical? Graph isomorphism testing determines if two graphs are structurally identical, with applications in graph classification, clustering, and other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.sstatic.net/j5sGu.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the general problem has no known polynomial-time solution, the WL test is an efficient heuristic that works well in practice. The WL test iteratively refines node labels by hashing the multiset of neighboring labels\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../figs/weisfeiler-lehman-test.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The WL test works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign all nodes the same initial label.\n",
    "2. For each node, collect the labels of all its neighbors and *aggregate them* into a hash (e.g., new label). For example, the top node gets {0} from its neighbors, resulting in a collection {0,0}. A new label is created via a hash function $h$ that maps {0, {0, 0}} to a new label 1.\n",
    "3. Repeat the process for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the implementation of the WL test in Python:"
