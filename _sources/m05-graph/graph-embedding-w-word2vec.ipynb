    "# Graph embedding with word2vec\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we apply word2vec to graph data? There is a critical challenge: word2vec takes sequence of words as input, while graph data are discrete and unordered. A solution to fill this gap is *random walk*, which transforms graph data into a sequence of nodes. Once we have a sequence of nodes, we can treat it as a sequence of words and apply word2vec.\n",

    "DeepWalk is one of the pioneering works to apply word2vec to graph data {footcite}`perozzi2014deepwalk`. It views the nodes as words and the nodes random walks on the graph as sentences, and applies word2vec to learn the node embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, the method contains the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample multiple random walks from the graph.\n",
    "2. Treat the random walks as sentences and feed them to word2vev to learn the node embeddings.\n",

    "- **Skip-gram model**: it trains word2vec by predicting context words given a target word. For example, given the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", in the skip-gram model, given the target word \"fox\", the model will try to predict the context words \"quick\", \"brown\", \"jumps\", and \"over\". If `sg=0`, the input and output are swapped: the model will predict the target word from the context words, e.g., given the context words \"quick\", \"brown\", \"jumps\", and \"over\", the model will predict the target word \"fox\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hierarchical softmax**: To understand hierarchical softmax better, let's break down how the word2vec model works. The goal of word2vec is to predict context words given a target word. For example, if our target word is $w_t$ and our context word is $w_c$, we want to find the probability of $w_c$ given $w_t$. This probability is calculated using the softmax function:\n",

    "\n",
    "    Here, $\\mathbf{v}_w$ and $\\mathbf{u}_w$ represent the vector for word $w$ as context and target respectively, and $V$ is the entire vocabulary. The tricky part is the denominator, which requires summing over all words in the vocabulary. If we have a large vocabulary, this can be very computationally expensive. Imagine having to compute 100,000 exponentials and their sum for each training example if our vocabulary size is 100,000!\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hierarchical softmax helps us solve this problem. Instead of calculating the probability directly, it organizes the vocabulary into a binary tree, where each word is a leaf node. To find the probability of a word, we calculate the product of probabilities along the path from the root to the leaf node. This method significantly reduces the computational complexity. Instead of being proportional to the vocabulary size, it becomes proportional to the logarithm of the vocabulary size. This makes it much more efficient, especially for large vocabularies.\n",
