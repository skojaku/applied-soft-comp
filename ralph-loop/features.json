      "Narrative format - write in flowing prose, not lists",
      "Short paragraphs - 2-4 sentences max, break up long blocks",
      "Be concise and clear - no fluff, get to the point",
      "Appeal to intuition - explain the 'why' before the 'how'",
      "No em-dashes (---) - use periods to split sentences, or commas/parentheses for clauses",
      "Use 'We' and 'You' for direct address",
      "Direct opening statements - start sections with 'Let's talk about X' or 'The key idea is...'",

      "Use direct address naturally (Let's talk about..., Put on a math hat..., Have you ever wondered...)",
      "Embed questions to guide reader thinking (But how do we solve this? Which one should we choose?)",
      "Walk through math step by step, explaining each transformation",
      "Connect abstract concepts to practical applications and real-world examples",
