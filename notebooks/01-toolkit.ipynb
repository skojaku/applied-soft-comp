        "This module guides you through setting up your Python development environment. You'll learn how to create a virtual environment using uv, install all necessary packages for this course, and verify your installation by importing key libraries we'll use throughout the semester.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Why a Consistent Environment Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we dive into data analysis, we need to get our tools in order. A well-configured development environment saves you from dependency conflicts, version mismatches, and the dreaded \"works on my machine\" problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll use `uv` to manage our Python environment. If you're familiar with `pip` and `virtualenv`, think of `uv` as a faster, more reliable alternative. It handles package installation and dependency resolution with impressive speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The best part? It works seamlessly with the `pyproject.toml` file that defines all course dependencies. One command installs everything you need.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setting Up Your Environment\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's walk through the setup process. The first step is creating a virtual environment. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then run this command:\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "uv venv\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This creates an isolated Python environment in a `.venv` directory. Virtual environments keep project dependencies separate from your system Python, preventing conflicts between different projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "::: {.column-margin}\n",
        "**Note:** If you don't have `uv` installed yet, you can install it by following the instructions at [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). On macOS and Linux, you can use `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`. On Windows, use `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"`.\n",
        ":::\n",
        "\n",
        "The second step is activating the environment. This tells your terminal to use the Python interpreter and packages from your virtual environment instead of the system-wide installation.\n",
        "\n",
        "On macOS and Linux, use:\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "source .venv/bin/activate\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "On Windows, use:\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        ".venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "You'll notice your terminal prompt changes to show `(.venv)` at the beginning. This indicates the environment is active.\n",
        "\n",
        "The third step is installing all course dependencies. Since this project uses a `pyproject.toml` file, one command installs everything:\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "uv pip install -e .\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The `-e` flag installs the project in \"editable\" mode, which is useful if you're developing or modifying code. The installation might take a few minutes since we're installing many powerful libraries for data science, machine learning, and network analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Verifying Your Installation\n",
        "\n",
        "Now comes the moment of truth. Let's verify that all required libraries are properly installed. The code cell below imports every major library we'll use in this course.\n",
        "\n",
        "If everything is set up correctly, this cell will run without errors. If you encounter import errors, double check that you activated your virtual environment and ran the installation command."
