    "**What you'll learn in this module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This module guides you through setting up your Python development environment. You'll learn how to create a virtual environment using uv, install all necessary packages for this course, and verify your installation by importing key libraries we'll use throughout the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why a Consistent Environment Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into data analysis, we need to get our tools in order. A well-configured development environment saves you from dependency conflicts, version mismatches, and the dreaded \"works on my machine\" problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use `uv` to manage our Python environment. If you're familiar with `pip` and `virtualenv`, think of `uv` as a faster, more reliable alternative. It handles package installation and dependency resolution with impressive speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best part? It works seamlessly with the `pyproject.toml` file that defines all course dependencies. One command installs everything you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!IMPORTANT]\n",
    "> **Windows Users:** This course uses Unix-based command line tools. You need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to follow along. WSL provides a Linux environment directly on Windows.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **To install WSL:**\n",
    "> 1. Open PowerShell as Administrator\n",
    "> 2. Run: `wsl --install`\n",
    "> 3. Restart your computer\n",
    "> 4. After restart, Ubuntu will open automatically to complete setup\n",
    "> 5. Create a username and password when prompted\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Once installed, use the Ubuntu terminal (not PowerShell or Command Prompt) for all course commands. You can find it by searching \"Ubuntu\" in the Start menu.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For more details, see [Microsoft's WSL installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the setup process. Open your terminal (macOS/Linux: Terminal app, Windows: Ubuntu from WSL) and navigate to the project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is creating a virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates an isolated Python environment in a `.venv` directory. Virtual environments keep project dependencies separate from your system Python, preventing conflicts between different projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!NOTE]\n",
    "> If you don't have `uv` installed yet, install it with:\n",
    "> ```bash\n",
    "> curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> This command works on macOS, Linux, and WSL on Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is activating the environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice your terminal prompt changes to show `(.venv)` at the beginning. This indicates the environment is active.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third step is installing all course dependencies. Since this project uses a `pyproject.toml` file, one command installs everything:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-e` flag installs the project in \"editable\" mode, which is useful if you're developing or modifying code. The installation might take a few minutes since we're installing many powerful libraries for data science, machine learning, and network analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Verifying Your Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes the moment of truth. Let's verify that all required libraries are properly installed. The code cell below imports every major library we'll use in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything is set up correctly, this cell will run without errors. If you encounter import errors, double check that you activated your virtual environment and ran the installation command."

    "### Pushing to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "You've been making commits locally, but they only exist on your computer so far. Let's push them to GitHub so they're backed up and your instructor can see your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!IMPORTANT]\n",
    "> Your instructor will review your work directly on GitHub. Work that exists only on your local computer cannot be seen or graded. You must push your commits to make them visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you cloned this repository, the connection to GitHub (called the \"remote\") is already set up. The remote is named `origin`. You can verify this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git remote -v\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows you the URL of your GitHub repository. Now push your commits:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git push origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `git push` command uploads your local commits to GitHub. The word `origin` refers to your GitHub repository, and `main` is the branch you're pushing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visit your repository page on GitHub and refresh it. You should now see your `analysis.py` file and all your commits! Click on \"commits\" to see your commit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Develop a habit of pushing frequently.** After completing each exercise section, push your work. This keeps your local repository and GitHub in sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now push your other branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git push origin add-median\n",
    "git push origin use-numpy-mean\n",
    "git push origin add-mean-docstring\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Visit your repository on GitHub. Click the \"branches\" dropdown near the top left (next to the branch icon). You'll see all your branches listed. GitHub provides a visual interface for viewing diffs, commit history, and branch structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syncing Your Work\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've been working on another computer or if someone else pushed changes to GitHub, you can pull those changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git pull origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This fetches and merges changes from GitHub into your local branch. Always pull before you start working and push when you're done to keep everything synchronized.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!IMPORTANT]\n",
    "> **Verify Your Work is Pushed**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Your instructor will review your work directly on GitHub. Before you finish, ensure everything is pushed.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Check synchronization:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```bash\n",
    "> git status\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You should see: `\"Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'\"` and `\"nothing to commit, working tree clean\"`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Verify on GitHub:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Visit your repository page on GitHub and check that you see:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - [ ] The `analysis.py` file with both `calculate_mean()` and `calculate_median()` functions\n",
    "> - [ ] At least 5 commits in your history\n",
    "> - [ ] Multiple branches: `main`, `add-median`, `use-numpy-mean`, `add-mean-docstring`\n",
    "> - [ ] A merge commit showing conflict resolution\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **If anything is missing, push it:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```bash\n",
    "> git push origin main\n",
    "> git push origin branch-name\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!TIP]\n",
    "> **Practice makes perfect**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The more you use Git, the more natural it becomes:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Make commits as you work, not just at the end\n",
    "> - Push frequently to back up your progress\n",
    "> - Experiment with branches for different approaches\n",
    "> - Use `git log --oneline --graph --all` to visualize your history\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Soon branching and merging will be second nature!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control transforms how you work. You can experiment fearlessly knowing you can always return to a working state. You can try multiple approaches in parallel. You can collaborate with teammates without coordination headaches. You can review your project's evolution to understand how you got here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every professional software project uses version control. Data science projects benefit just as much. When your analysis depends on dozens of interdependent scripts and notebooks, version control becomes essential for reproducibility and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, we'll use Git to track our work. You'll create commits after completing exercises, branch when experimenting with different approaches, and merge when you've found solutions that work. These workflows will become second nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started."
